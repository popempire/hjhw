Since around the beginning of the 20th century, there has been a single dominant
musical style in American culture: the American Popular Style, which today could
also be called the Imperial Popular Style.

Its consituent genres, such as rock, folk, jazz, rhythm & blues, soul, gospel,
rap, techno, etc., are just marketing terms.
They have been incessantly defined & redefined, renamed, realigned,
always in the interest of more effective marketing of commercially produced music.
This effort is fundamentally motivated by interest in making money from musical
compositions and recordings rather than by characterizing the living development
of the American folk idiom. In some cases, the realignments of, say, the 
*Billboard* charts reflect a development in the listening habits of a large
number of people — and in many cases, these realignments instead reflect, 
or seem designed to reinforce, some social division (often racial) that would
otherwise be obscured the diffusion of new popular tastes across these divides.

Countless genres and styles arise as evolutionary developments of some aspect
of the American Popular Style. Many of these prove to be temporary, as they are
subsumed into one of the congolmerating stylistic labels. So it is with ragtime,
swing, boogie, hokum, hillbilly, and many others. The musical characteristics
of these genres remain part of the Popular stylistic repertoire — they become 
naturalized into the empire. Eventually, the distinctions between rock, jazz,
hip-hop, disco, and folk will be of merely academic interest to historians of
the Imperial Popular Style.

This Imperial style will be incredibly influential for centuries to come.
For those of us who are alive in these formative years when this music still has
an immense native vivacity while increaingly coming under threat from plutocratic
commercial interests, our duty is to pay no heed to the genre terms developed
by marketers while preserving and fortifying the elements of this music which
have the greatest spiritual power to do good in the lives of future generations
of the world's children. Among these elements, I believe, are 
an emphasis on unredacted personal truth-telling 
which is the hallmark of the best blues, country, and rap music; 
a fixation on death, a hallmark of much folk and gospel; 
and a groundedness in the walking, rocking, hopping, dancing movements of the 
human body, i.e. a commitment to *having a good beat*.

Of these three identified elements of the Imperial Popular Style,
only the last one is perceived in the halls of power to pose no risk to the
imperial political order. The element of truth-telling is neutered, co-written into
conventionalized sentiments. The fixation on death is suppressed.

Along with Hollywood, Coca-Cola, and the Internet, the Popular Style
is one of the four horsemen of American soft power around the globe.

Tom Dula
--------

In a place called Happy Valley, in Wilkes County, North Carolina, just shortly
before the Civil War, there was a boy named Tom Dula. He was the youngest of
four, with two brothers and a sister.

Nearby lived Anne Foster, a year or so older than Tom, one of five children of Lottie Foster. 
No father to these children seems to have been in the picture, 
and Lottie was reputed to be an alcoholic. When Anne was 15 or 16, she was
married to a man who was several years older, a farmer and a passive man,
named Melton.

A couple weeks after the wedding, Lottie caught her daughter Anne and the lad Tom
sleeping together in her cabin. She ran him out the door immediately.

In many reports, Anne was the *it girl* of Happy Valley. She had many
suitors even after her marriage, and it is possible that she was receptive to
some of them. At the very least, she and Tom maintained their sexual relationship.
He would stay with her in the one-room cabin she shared with her husband,
and they would sometimes rendezvous in the barn.

The Civil War intervened. North Carolina joined the Confederacy, but the region
around Wilkes County was tortuously split in its sympathies. Many folks supported
the Union, even forming Union military units — across the nearby Tennessee border,
this proportion was even higher. The Dulas and Meltons and their immediate
community in Happy Valley, nonetheless, supported the rebellion. Tom's two older
brothers as well as Melton joined the Confederate Army. A couple years later,
when he was 17, Tom joined up too.

All of them saw heavy action. 
Tom was reputed to be lazy and sometimes violent, but fearless in battle.
He was believed by some of his troopmates to have murdered the husband of a 
woman with whom he had an illicit affair during the war.
He was promoted from the rank of private to musician, 
which typically meant he would have played the drum to keep the unit's movements
in time.
Both of Tom's brothers were killed.
Tom and Melton were both taken prisoner, taken to a northern POW camp for a time
until a couple months after the end of the war.

Things take up much as they had been, Melton returned to his cabin and his waiting
wife Anne, and Tom was her frequent visitor.




Frankie and Johnny
------------------

### Frankie Baker

In 1899, Francine "Frankie" Baker was successful twenty-two year old African-American
boardinghouse owner and prostitue in St. Louis, MO. She met Allen "Al" Britt, 
a seventeen year old piano player and a hip cat, at the Orange Blossom Ball. 
He soon became her live-in boyfriend. 
Meanwhile, he was having an affair with another prostitute named Alice Pryor. 
One fateful October night,
Frankie walked down from her boardinghouse to the saloon where Al was performing
and discovered him with Alice. 

  > Allen Britt's brief experience in the art of love cost him his life.
  >
  > — *St. Louis Post-Dispatch*, October 19, 1899

They quarreled loudly, the argument spilling out into the street. Frankie begged
Al to come home with her, she threatened to turn him out of the house, though
eventually she returned home alone. Al stayed at the bar for several more hours,
becoming very drunk before returning to Frankie's boardinghouse around 3 am.
He found her there awake in bed, and they began to quarrel again. He pulled a
knife on her, and she pulled out a .38 from under her pillow. 
(She said that she usually slept with a gun under her pillow.)
She shot him once in the stomach, and he staggered away. 
He was able to make it a couple blocks away to his parents' house.
He died a couple days later, having informed the police that Francine Baker had
been his murderer.
She was arrested, tried, and found not guilty, having acted in self-defense.

### Frankie Silver

*The American Songbag* (1925?) claims that *Frankie and Albert*
"was common along the Mississippi river and among railroad men of the middle west
as early as 1888".
If the true story that inspired the ballad of Frankie and Albert occurred in 1899,
how is this possible? Is this simply an exaggeration on the part of the editors
of the *Songbag*? Very possibly, yes.
Overstating the antiquity of one's sources is an old tradition
among folk singers and folklorists alike which can be traced back to Adam & Eve.

But as it turns out, there are indeed other earlier references to *Frankie*
ballads dating back to the 19th century.



Young Hunting
-------------

*Young Hunting* is just one of many names given to the protagonist in this family
of ballads. It is the name used in the earliest of the versions collected as 
no. 68 in the Child ballads. From very early on, the names of this young man,
and of the one or two other characters in the story, show considerable variability.
*Young Riedan* was once a popular variant. *Earl Richard* became a widespread
name for the ballad in its native Scotland. In the variants that survived among
Appalachian descendants of the Scots-Irish, he often goes by the name *Love Henry*
or *Henry Lee*.

This ballad was in circulation sometime prior to the 1770s. It seems to have
become quite popular in Scotland, and in the 19th century it spread across Britain,
even to parts of Scandinavia. It also spread to North America. 
Over time, the ballad essentially disappeared from England and became obscure in
Scotland, while the Appalachian offshoot *Henry Lee* had a resurgence in popularity
among the old-time singers in America.

The Appalachian *Love Henry* ballads of this family often retain a good deal of
antique detail from older ballads of Young Hunting, Earl Richard et al., 
at least in certain verses. Notably, however, the American versions tend to
omit a great deal of the narrative found in the first Scottish versions.
It's almost as if half of Act II and all of Act III had been omitted from the play.
This truncation gives the ballad a whole new emotional arc.

...

Once the crime has been committed, Lady Maisry finds out that a talking bird
has witnessed the dirty deeds. She tries both carrots and sticks to ensure the
bird's silence, and they taunt each other back and forth.

This is where most of the American versions end. The result is that the 
conversation with the talking bird takes on an increased perceptual signifiance
in the narrative, which becomes balanced between two conversations — 
between the murderess and Henry Lee, between the murderess and the bird.
