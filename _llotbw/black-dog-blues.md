## Graveyard Blues

<https://youtu.be/VDwf8aWNbBA>

Roscoe Holcomb's "Graveyard Blues" is a perfect specimen of Appalachian blues
poetry. It opens with the lines "I got up this morning / with the blues  all around my bed"
— this phrase, or a close variant, is the opening of thousands of blues. 
It functions somewhat like the phrase "Once upon a time in a land far away".

As the narrative unfolds, Roscoe sings of an encounter with a gravedigger in a 
graveyard. The singer pleads with this gravedigger to return a deceased loved one.
This resonates with the lyrics of other country blues that feature negotiation
with a custodian of the dead (e.g. "I asked that undertaker / 'Undertaker, please drive
slow'" in "Can the Circle Be Unbroken"). In some songs, the negotiation is 
with Death personified ("O Death"), or with some supernatural custodian of the dead (Charon, 
Hades, the Devil, St. Peter, et al.). The choice of a naturalistic, human 
interlocutor in this role in Holcomb's version underscores
the gritty reality of the emotions of pain and loss which are expressed in the song.

One of the great poetic powers of blues lyricism is to linger on a certain 
*feeling* for an extended, indefinite period — really milking it for all its worth —
and then, very suddenly, at the end of a phrase to shift the entire context or
meaning of that feeling.

Just as Holcomb's "Graveyard Blues" reaches its emotional climax, "Then I wrung
my hands / Says I wanted to scream" — and we'll definitely take a moment to 
dwell on this feeling — the opening line of the song is repeated, "I got up this morning,"
and the entire context of the song is shifted: "and found it was only a dream".

Some dreams seem to be chaotic and random, kind of like mental white noise. 
Some dreams seem to carry symbolism and yet their meanings are very obscure.
Some dreams have quite a plain meaning, if you will look them square in the eyes.
They show us our own feelings, the fundamental truths of our own lives. The love
of a partner, family member, or dear friend is one of these truths, and as an
*emotion*, loving someone is very much like recognizing that your own thriving
is dependent on their life and thriving.

Revealing some emotionally charged sequence of events to be a dream is of course
a classic narrative trick for releasing tension and inducing surprise at the 
same time. By executing this shift quickly, "Graveyard Blues" is structured 
much like some jokes, with a slow build leading up to a quick punchline, then out.
Given the content of the song, it doesn't hit so much like a joke because humor
is not the dominant flavor here, yet there is indeed a recognizable *playfulness*.
Because the song has lingered so long on the *pain of loss*, but then suddenly
removed all the sting of this loss by revealing it to be a dream, we are left
reflecting on the meaning of this pain from a remove. It is in fact a very
sweet and melancholy affirmation of a singer's love, of a singer's needing 
another for their inmost thriving.

## Clay From the River

<https://theyearoftheraccoon.bandcamp.com/album/the-year-of-the-raccoon>

      A song for a stone
      That's what you get when you're wandering alone
      For love will ebb and flow
      But the rocks they know, they know

      And we drank the water out from the river
      It wasn't too white, we felt alright
      And we found a feather in a tangle of fur
      Freshly spilled blood, tracks in the mud

      A poem for a tree
      That's what you write when your mind runs free
      And the North Wind never sleeps
      But the cottonwood's roots run deep

      And we watched the sunset paint everything strange
      Purple and green, alien scene
      And we let the fire take over our world
      Embers trailed high, stars dripped from the sky

      A prayer for the earth
      That's what you write when you sleep with the dirt
      And the grass will make your bed
      And the ground will hold tour head

      And we heard the coyotes sing without words
      Soul-chilling cries, tears in my eyes
      And we drifted into the silence of sleep
      Sun's warmth now lost, all covered in frost

      Oh it takes time and clay from the river
      To ease my troubled mind
      Yeah it's gonna take time and clay from the river
      To ease my troubled mind
