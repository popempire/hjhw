A sonnet by Gerard Manley Hopkins, written in 1877, not published until the 1910s

---

    The world is charged with the grandeur of God.
        It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;
        It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil
    Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?
    Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;
        And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;
        And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil
    Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

    And for all this, nature is never spent;
        There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;
    And though the last lights off the black West went
        Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs —
    Because the Holy Ghost over the bent
        World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.

The descriptions of God's grandeur as "shining from shook foil" and "the ooze of
oil crushed" are vivid and unusual. They suggest a sense of awe towards the 
natural world and the splendid complexity of life and the cosmos, even as it is
found in ordinary life. Then comes the question that always arises after someone
has experienced this profound sense of awe — why doesn't everyone feel it?
why can't I feel it all the time? 

Of course, it is well known in the context of Christianity that sin and death
entered the world that is so amazing and was originally perfect. 
Human dissociation from the divine is always where we start the Christian story.
But what the nature of that original sin may be varies from telling to telling.
Calling it "disobedience" to God just kicks the can down the road,
substituting one catch-all term for another. It tends to take a very personal
shape for each individual, the thing that keeps them disconnected from the divine.

In the book of Genesis, the first sin, 
the big one that kicked off everything bad in human life, 
is reported to be eating a certain fruit.
For six thousand years, people hearing and retelling this story have had a 
strong intuition to understand this as some kind of allegory,
but there is no agreement on what it symbolizes.

Hopkins' sonnet retraces the tale of the creation and the garden of Eden as told
in Genesis: the world is amazing and awe-inspiring in every detail, yet humans
have brought sin into it. Interestingly, this state of sin in the world and 
in the human race closely mirrors the hallmarks of industrial and 
capitalistic "progress". This seems like a pointed reaction to the Industrial
Revolution which had, in the decades prior to the writing of this poem,
so changed the English countryside as well as much of the rest of the world.
But by comparison to what we see now, the level of exploitation of the natural
world to which we are accustomed, the scenese Hopkins was responding to would
likely seem rather idyllic. His sentiments seem to prefigure an environmentalist's
consciousness. In any case, the description of this anthropocene era as
"seared with trade" and tainted by human odors seems even more poignant today
than it was when it was written in 1877. 

Some religions are premised on the idea that people are in need of salvation
from something. They are disconnected from God, from the fullness of life,
from Nature, etc., and they cannot bridge the gap without a helping hand.
Christianity is certainly one such religion, teaching that humans need to be
saved from the consequences of their own sins, i.e. their shortcomings, failures,
imperfections. The consequences are said to be pretty severe, often involving
an eternal lake of fire, but at a more fundamental theological level, the
consequence is continued separation from God, i.e. separation from life, goodness,
and being.

Hopkins wrote this poem a Catholic priest. Original sin is a well established
doctrine within Catholicism, which postulates that all humans are born in a 
state of sin: that is, by their nature, humans come into the world dissociated
from the divine, separated from God.

The masculine aspect of the divine depicted in the first stanza (the God whose
efficacy is symbolized by his rod) is contrasted with the feminine aspect of the
divine in the second (the Holy Ghost who broods over her offspring).
In this comparison, favor is given to the feminine aspect.

Insofar as the divine is understood as the active and organizing principle in Nature,
which emanates both the structure of the cosmos as well as the very impetus for
its being, the mode in which all animals participate in the divine, genus *Homo*
included, is called *instinct*. Instinct is the animal nature becoming one with God.

We tend to admire instinct when we see it playing out in other animals,
but we tend to misunderstand and malign it within our own species.
"Instincts" tend to be associated with baser needs and desires, and with
unintelligent responses to stimuli — contrasted with rational, educated,
or "thought-out" actions. This is based on a false dichotomy: instinct is not
opposed to *thought* at all, because *thinking* is one of our most basic instincts.
Of course, thinking does sometimes interfere with other instincts. This is not
unique to thinking. We have a great many instincts and all of them can interfere
with each other.

The shift from singular to plural in "instincts" is subtle but important to notice.
It is like a kind of sleight of hand, unless we acknowledge that we tend to look
at the actions of other species (and of other people, to a lesser extent) as a
complex but basically describable system that can be explained, if desired, by 
referring to a singular *instinct*. Within our own lives, we see a massive range
of possibilities and uncertainties — we feel that what is about to happen next
to us or in us could hardly be explained by any singular force. Except God, of course.

Thinking is instinct. Language is instinct — though more particularly it is an
instinct of groups of people, rather than of an individual organism. The building
blocks of language, such as mouth sounds and hand gestures, *are* instincts of
individual humans (apes generally). We learn to refine and utilize these instincts
in service of linguistic instincts with which they intertwine — and still sometimes
we hear or emit a sound that goes beyond language, which has no clear denotation
yet seems to be packed full to the brim with raw meaning. Howls and screams and
grunts and groans are called "instinctual" because they represent a certain
set of instincts which are considered baser overcome another set which normally
constrain the expression of those instincts. Linguistic uses of the voice normally 
supress howling, "being normal" normally supresses dancing. When these ways of 
behaving break out of their shackles, we often have the impression that we are
in the presence of the divine in some way.

The hierarchies we impose on the various components of our instinct 
(which depend on the mostly arbitrary categories we divide them by)
do nothing to change the underlying fact that they are all just facets of 
our singular Instinct.

The fear of god is an instinct. 
(At least, it was. It sounds stilted now, but I'm not sure what they call it these days.)
It is not being afraid of god. 
An English speaker would naturally get this confused.
The fear of spiders (*arachnaphobia*) is being afraid of spiders.
The fear of butterflies (*lepidopterophobia*) is being afraid of butterflies.
This is a standardized formula: "The fear of ___".
But the fear of god is the fear that comes with the presence of god.
It may seems like an overly subtle distinction between this and being afraid of god,
but the difference makes sense when you consider what we've said about the
divine nature of instinct. 

Some people who do not have a great deal of faith in Nature
propose that there must be a great and final judgment, at some point, to truly
understand the fear of god. That is simply unnecessary. The fear that comes with
instinct is no more or less than an anxiety about how one shall act.
People don't need to be (can't be?) taught it, because it is an instinct.
At the same time, it is one among many other instincts, some which may override it.
The habit of reinforcing this instinct is called *wisdom*, and that is why
the fear of god is called the beginning or root of wisdom.
