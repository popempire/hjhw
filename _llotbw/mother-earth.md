    You may high hat me all the time
    You may never go my way
    Mother Earth is lying there for you
    'Cause of that debt you've got to pay

    I don't care how great you are
    Don't care what you're worth
    When it all ends up you've got to go on back home to Mother Earth

    You may play the race horses
    You may own a race track
    You may have enough money, baby,
    To buy anything you lack

    [Refrain]

    You may own half a city
    Even diamonds and pearls
    You may buy an airplane, baby,
    And fly all over this world

    [Refrain]

    When it all ends up you've got to go on back home to Mother Earth

  > God gave me the grace to know the *world* only enough to hold it in contempt
  and remove myself from it... I was received with open arms, fussed over, 
  admired... I admit that this life had charms for me... At the age of ten the
  heart can easily let itself be dazzled, so I see it as a great grace not to
  have stayed in Alençon. The friends that we had there were too worldly...
  They didn't think about *death* enough, and yet *death* has come to visit a
  great number of persons whom I have known, young, rich, and happy!  
  > 
  > — St. Therese of Lisieux, *The Story of a Soul*, trans. Robert J. Edmonson, Paraclete Press 2006, pp. 71-72

    You can ignore the fact, turn your back
    You can look the other way
    One day you'll be on your back
    Under six foot of cold, cold clay

    You may be oh so beautiful
    With all kinds of precious stones
    Those stones will keep their beauty
    After all of yours is gone

    You may change your nationality
    You may change your date of birth
    But we are just one big family
    All children of Mother Earth

    Ashes to ashes
    and dust to dust

— from *Blue Memphis* (released in France 1970, in USA 1971)

Is it possible to know how to orient ourselves towards death?
