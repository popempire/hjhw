    You may high hat me all the time
    You may never go my way
    Mother Earth is lying there for you
    'Cause of that debt you've got to pay

    I don't care how great you are
    Don't care what you're worth
    When it all ends up you've got to go on back home to Mother Earth

    You may play the race horses
    You may own a race track
    You may have enough money, baby,
    To buy anything you lack

    [Refrain]

    You may own half a city
    Even diamonds and pearls
    You may buy an airplane, baby,
    And fly all over this world

    [Refrain]

    When it all ends up you've got to go on back home to Mother Earth

  > God gave me the grace to know the *world* only enough to hold it in contempt
  and remove myself from it... I was received with open arms, fussed over, 
  admired... I admit that this life had charms for me... At the age of ten the
  heart can easily let itself be dazzled, so I see it as a great grace not to
  have stayed in Alençon. The friends that we had there were too worldly...
  They didn't think about *death* enough, and yet *death* has come to visit a
  great number of persons whom I have know, young, rich, and happy!

    - St. Therese of Lisieux, *The Story of a Soul* pp. 71-72 (trans. Robert J. Edmonson, Paraclete Press 2006)
