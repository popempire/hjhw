  > Preacher have you told them  
  > That hell is real
  > The big one's coming, sure as hell
  > And no one's at the wheel

These lines are annotated in the manuscript as a "literal description of driving
down I-75 on acid".

  > A friend of mine sold acid (LSD) one summer when he was in college to make
  a bit of extra money. He would buy a few sheets and cut the sheets into strips.
  One day he decided to transport a few strips surreptitiously by placing them
  in his shoe. LSD is a Schedule I drug after all, and getting caught with intent
  to sell was a much bigger deal than, say, getting caught with Marijuana (which
  was in fact still a bit of a big deal back then, unlike today). He placed the
  strips in tinfoil, but only enfolded them like a pocketbook, rather than 
  wrapping them completely. Some of the strips moved about in his shoe, and in
  that moist environment the acid began to dissolve and pass through his socks,
  through his epidermis, and into his bloodstream.

  > He realized he was tripping as he was driving down Interstate 75. He read the
  billboard that says "Hell Is Real" and saw an enormous gyrating spiral of 
  color consume the road in front of him.

They are also a reference to:

  + Satan Is Real - Louvin Brothers

satan is a *narrative imperative*.
although he doesn't strictly make sense in the context of a developed high
theology monotheism, the Christian intellectualists have been unable to 
exorcise him from the popular imagination.

  + The Devil Was a Preacher - Pop Empire

from the album *The Devil's Party*, which was thematically inspired by Milton's
*Paradise Lost*. The name comes from a quote by William Blake, who said of 
Milton, "he was a true poet, and of the devil's party without knowing it".

*Paradise Lost* was meant to be just the opening act for *Paradise Regained*,
just as *Inferno* was just the first part in Dante's Divine Comedy Trilogy.
Yet why have these descriptions of the darkest parts of our imagination
turned out to be so much more interesting than the supposed climaxes of the 
story?

The album cover for the Louvin Brothers' *Satan Is Real* is perhaps more famous
today than the music, thanks to our culture's infatuation with consuming an endless
stream of images with very little context. Most reasonable people would agree
that the cover artwork is hilariously funny, and it's been shared millions of 
times on the internet as one of the funniest album covers of all time. 
This humorous impact was not at all intended by the artists, and unfortunately, 
this association may at times obscure the fact that the 1959 album is a true 
landmark of country gospel music. Even more unfortunately, at least as Ira Louvin
would probably see it, this comedic interpretation may obscure the sincere
profundity of the message in the music.

The Byrds were right to pay homage to the Louvin Brothers by performing some of
their best songs, such as "The Christian Life". Their version released on
*Sweetheart of the Rodeo* in 1968 pales in comparison
to the original, however, not least because one never suspects that there is a
great deal of sincerity in the singing of the line "I like the Christian life"
nor any deep understanding of the loneliness that comes with remaining steadfast
to a truth you know when it feels like the whole world would mock you for it.
(Roger McGuinn, who sang lead on the Byrds' recording, would later avow a Christian
faith, but not until about a decade after *Sweetheart of the Rodeo* — influenced
in part by his reflections on the death of Elvis in 1977, who was just seven
years older than him and "using all the same drugs".)

The duo are featured in a rock quarry posing before a 12-foot plywood devil and 
actual fires fueled by kerosene-soaked tires.
The brothers went to great lengths and took significant physical risks to capture 
the image. During the shoot, the heat caused rocks to explode, nearly injuring them.
A sudden rain shower made the scene even more treacherous, while fortuitously
causing steam to rise from the flames as if to portray the noxious smoke of hellfire.

However imposing the hand-built wooden devil may have seemed in person at the time,
it looks like a cartoon image to modern eyes. The brothers are pictured gesturing
dramatically in clean white matching suits, presenting an image that hardly reads
as sincerity in today's visual parlance. For them, the artistic direction of the
photo shoot was unencumbered by any need to convey a star persona; they merely
presented themselves quite sincerely as professional entertainers of the day.
Who happen to be performing in front of the fires of Hell and in the presence
of Old Scratch himself.

Privileged men in their ivory towers may debate proofs for or against 
"the existence of God", but most of these are ineffectual (on both sides) because
they fail to touch the heart of the matter.
If you don't believe in God then the argument that, by definition, God must exist
(the ontological argument in a nutshell) does nothing to convince you.
Conversely, if you belive in God, then the argument that God is impossible
(the omnipotence paradox, e.g.) does nothing to dissuade you.

From a less esoteric point of view — from the perspective of folk religion, i.e.
the spiritual practice of the people, the two most glaring issues with the 
Christian message are inheritances from its ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman 
origins: they are the problem of evil and the lack of feminine perspective[^1].
Consequently, there have always been strong urges in popular Christianity to
promote both the Devil and Mary to positions of greater importance than the 
foundational sacred texts can strictly support.

To a strict monotheist, the Devil is not a counterpart to God, he is only a
created being, infinitely less powerful than the Almighty. For Protestant Christians,
who predominate in the United States, veneration of Mary is tantamount to idolatry.
Furthermore, neither of these characters figure as significantly in the Bible itself
as one might suspect if you're more familiar with popular depictions than with
the text itself.
Yet for many people, without elevating one or both of these characters to a place
of power just below that of Jesus,
the Christian message just fails to connect on a spiritual level.

[^1]: If this claim touches a nerve with conservative evangelicals, perhaps
that is because the nail is hit on the head.

In the story of the Garden of Eden, in the book of *Genesis*, Adam and Eve,
the first humans, are tempted into sin and ruination by a serpent. Maybe this
serpent was the Devil, maybe it wasn't — the text just calls him "the serpent". 
He's a talking serpent, which is suspicious, and he's considered the most 
cunning of all the creatures, but not explicity identified as the Devil. 
While the serpent does seem to provide the initial impetus for sinning, i.e.
eating fruit from a forbidden tree, the level of punishment doled out by God
seems to indicate that the serpent is judged merely to be an accomplice in the 
crime, not the mastermind. He has his legs taken away forever, which is pretty 
severe, but not more severe than the punishment for the humans, who are expelled
from the garden and condemned to work, suffer in childbirth, and die. One gets
the sense that God found the whole lot of them culpable, but is particularly 
disappointed in the humans, who ought to have known better.
