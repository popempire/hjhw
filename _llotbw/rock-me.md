title: Rock Me (Hide Me in Thy Bosom)
---

Composed by Rev. Thomas Dorsey (1937?)

Recorded by Sister Rosetta Tharpe during her first session (1938)

Recorded by Blind Willie McTell (1949, and another?)

My lyrics are slightly modified (as are those of every recorded version!)

    Mother, hear me praying
    Hear these words I keep saying
    Wash my soul with water from on high
    There's a world of fear around me
    You know evil thoughts will bind me
    Lover, if you leave me I will die

    You gotta hide me in thy bosom
    Till the storm of life is over, baby
    Rock me in the cradle of your love
    Just feed me till I want no more
    Take me to thy blessed home above

    Make my journey brighter
    Make my burden lighter
    Help me to do good wherever I can
    Just let thy presence thrill me
    Let your Holy Spirit fill me
    Hide me in the hollow of thy hand

    Hide me in thy bosom
    Till the storm of life is over, baby
    Rock me in the cradle of your love
    Just feed me till I want no more
    Take me to thy blessed home above

    Faith I am maintaining
    I go on uncomplaining
    But before this time another year
    My life may all forsake me
    Death may overtake me
    I'm with you I have no need to fear

    Because you hide me in thy bosom
    Till the storm of life is over, baby
    Rock me in the cradle of your love
    Just feed me till I want no more
    Take me to thy blessed home above
    Take me to thy blessed home above

The indebtedness of rock & roll to black gospel music cannot be overstated.
This music was originally referred to as *spirituals*. 
In the early 20th century, the developing recorded music industry tended to
lump all music made by blacks for black audiences together under the lablel
"race music". Black musicians and listeners tended to distinguish between
the *blues* or *goodtimes music* and *spirituals* based solely on the content of 
lyrics, regardless of the musical style. There was also *ragtime*, which in
today's terms we would think of as a more "poppy" style, which owed a great deal
to black musicians and composers, but was also intended for white audiences,
and which also drew from marching band and parlor music styles which were the 
mainstream popular music of the day.

Son House stated "You can sing the blues in church, if you use the *words* right".
(*Delta Blues & Spirituals*, Capitol 1995)

The tension between God and the Devil, between church and the blues, has been
definitive in the lives of many of American music's greatest artists. Like Son House,
Little Richard vacillated between two lives, while always maintaining an intense
fervor. The greatest practitioners of the pre-war country blues, such as 
Charley Patton, Lead Belly, and Blind Willie McTell, all maintained a collection
of spirituals in their repertoires, which they performed just as adeptly as their
secular songs. Blind Willie Johnson, whose tragic life afforded him very little
of worldly success, was a true hero of the slide guitar — an instrument which
was indelibly associated with barrelhouses and a life of sin in the minds of many
religious southerners — yet nearly all of his repertoire is concerned with
religious themes.

Reverend Thomas Dorsey is credited as one of the founding fathers of gospel music.
His compositional work was so characteristic and prolific that a whole class of
tunes became known as "Dorseys". He had a unique gift for writing songs that could
as naturally be played by a solo guitarist alongside a dirt road in the country
as by an ensemble of city slickers with the latest gear (including electrical
amplification). 

The popularization of the term "rock & roll" is widely attributed to Cleveland radio DJ
Alan Freed.
