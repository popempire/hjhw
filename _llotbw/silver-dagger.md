It is often remarked that the anglophone folk music tradition is especially
concerned with the themes of romantic love and murder. I think it can be 
considered inevitable that the former would arise as a theme when mating display,
sexual PR, has been one of the prime motivators of anglophone song-ways,
anthropologically speaking. But signalling one's suitability as a sexual partner —
trying to be hot — is not the sole motivator for the people's tradition of 
singing songs. Songs intended to serve as warnings to young people, and especially
as warnings to young women, should in fact be recognized as one of the dominant
categories of folk song.

"Silver Dagger" is the first track from Joan Baez's debut album. It was 
recorded and released in 1960, when Joan was just nineteen years old. Despite
her youth, her voice betrays an unmistakable vein of a very old wisdom, an
experience that has known deep sorrow, fiery passion of both ecstasy and rage,
desolation — and solemnly considers these emotions now from distance. How can
her young mind contain such wisdom, or how can she deploy illusion in such a way
as to evoke the presence of this ancestral voice of wisdom? For the magical work
of a truly gifted singer who knows how to sing the old songs is to use illusion
to bring about real presences.
