Roud 4192

This is drawn from a traditional text which is better known as "Tom Dooley",
as recorded by Doc Watson or The Kingston Trio.
The concerned fellow's name, as it was originally spelled, was *Dula*, 
while "Dooley" represents the Appalachian pronunciation of this name.
In this dialect, many names and words ending with "-a" are modified to "-ey" or "-ie".
For instance, "sodie pop" for "soda pop", or "Virginny" for "Virginia".
In his version of this song, Doc also sings of "poor Laurie Foster",
whom we recognize as *Laura* Foster.

The tune is our own variant of "Little Margaret" and has not been used for
this text before.

The Kingston Trio had a hit with their version of this song. 
Their recording of the ballad would go on to sell six million copies and might
more than any other song be credited with establishing "folk" as a
commercial muscial genre.
At the very first Grammy awards in 1959, *Tom Dooley* earned the Trio the award
for "Best Country & Western Recording". 
Furthemore, it became the main impetus for the establishment, in the following year,
of a new category for "Best Folk Performance", which the Trio was awarded for its
sophomore studio album.
This institutional recognition reflects the genuine impact that this ballad had
on the landscape of American commercial music, for this was the record that 
kicked off the folk music craze of the 1960s.

It might seem incredible today, as the name "Kingston Trio" is not nearly so well
remembered as names that became known in their wake, such as Bob Dylan, 
Joni Mitchell, or Peter, Paul, and Mary. Yet at the beginning of the sixties,
these boys from California were regarded as the "undisputed kings of the 
folk-singing rage by every yardstick".

The Kingston Trio themselves were not the founders of this domain which they had
conquered. They had in fact started as a loose collection of friends performing
Hawaiian and calypso music at college parties in San Francisco. In 1957, 
the founding lineup of the Trio solidified, and the group caught the attention
of an ambitious young publicist. The four of them formally established the group 
as equal partners, choosing their name as a reference to Kingston, Jamaica, for
its association with calypso music. The publicist imposed on them a uniform 
intended to appeal to the college audience that they saw as their market, and a 
strict rehearsal regimen.

Their commitment to the pursuit of commercial success would pay off, yet by 1961,
one of the founding members, Dave Guard, who was perceived by the media as the
frontman of the group, would depart amidst an acrimonious dispute. The dispute
had to do, of course, with money and with artistic direction. Guard, who was the
only member of the group who could read music and who had arranged most of the
band's material, seemed to be the only one among them who was sensitive to the
sharp criticism of the group from performers and die-hards of more traditional
American folk music — the Kingston Trio was selling a watered-down, smoothed-out,
glammed-up, polished "pop" version of folk music, without acknowledging their
indebtedness to the drivers of the original American folk music revival, which
had begun in the 1930s and 40s, nor their even earlier sources. Guard wanted to
develop the group's music into a more sophisticated and original style, while
the others were quite intent on fully cashing in on the formula they had
meticulously developed.

 > They clowned and hipswung. Then they came out with 'This time tomorrow, 
 > reckon where I'll be/If it hadn't a' been for Grayson/I'd a been in Tennessee.' 
 > I began to feel sorty sick. Like I'd lost a loved one. Tears came to my eyes. 
 > I went out and bawled on the ridge.
 >
 > — Frank Proffitt (recorded his version of *Tom Dooley* in 1939)

The Kingston Trio introduce the song with a spoken monologue, claiming the song
is about "the eternal triangle", i.e. a love triangle which they state involves
Tom Dooley, "a beautiful woman" (understood to be Laura Foster), and a Sherriff
Grayson. In their version, the original story seems quite garbled, like a vague
memory of a few facts or half-truths, but all out of order and filled in with
nonsense.

Doc Watson also 
recorded a version on his self-titled debut album (1964).
Watson's version has a much simpler arrangement and more repetitive melody,
but maintains more historical detail.

Frank Proffitt... (1939?)

Grayson & Whitter... (1928)

However, none of the versions of the ballad which survived to be recorded in the
20th century retain the full breadth of the salacious details which made the
story so sensational in its time and for many years to come.

"Sherriff" Grayson was not, as the Kingston Trio suggest, any rival of Tom's for
the affection of Laura Foster, though he would at times play the roles of both
antagonist and savior to Tom for the short period of his involvement in the tale.
He was probably the most important figure in the story who had never known Laura
at all — the only other contender for this title being Zebulon Vance, who 
represented Tom Dula and Ann Foster Melton at trial.

Grayson personally handed Dula over the Sherriff in Wilkes County, where he was 
wanted in connection with the disappearance of Laura Foster. His reason for doing
so was in fact to protect him from being lynched by the original posse that had 
set out after him, so that due process might be observerd. 
But the optics of a former confederate infantryman being
taken prisoner by a former Union officer and brough to stand trial for murder
likely factored in to Vance's decision to provide legal defense *pro bono*
for both Tom Dula and Ann Melton.

Vance scored a couple of tactical victories in the case, getting the trial moved
to Statesville and out of Wilkes County, where prejudice against Dula and Melton
seemed quite strong. After Tom was convicted in his first trial, Vance managed to
appeal the case to the state supreme court, but again the court delivered a
guilty verdict, and Tom was sentenced to be hanged.



The high profile of these two men, along with the lurid details of the case,
are likely the reason that the story was covered by media far outside isolated
Appalachian community of Wilkes County, North Carolina, by papers such as the
*New York Times*. No doubt, fresh off the Civil War and Lincoln's assassination,
Yankee readers were quite receptive to stories illustrating the depravity of
former Confederate hillbillies.

"The pock"

--- 

Tom Dula was born in 1844.

He was about fifteen when Lotty Foster found him in bed with her daughter Ann, 
who was a year or so older than Tom, 
and recently married to a somewhat older man named James Melton.

Melton, as well as Tom and his two older brothers, all served in the Confederate
Army during the Civil War. Tom, the youngest of the lot, joined up in 1862 when
he was still seventeen. Both of Tom's brothers died in the war, while James Melton
and Tom were taken prisoner after seeing heavy combat.

After the war, after their release from Union POW camps, both men returned to
their homes in Happy Valley. Tom and Ann resumed their relationship, unhindered
by Ann's marriage to Melton, who either did not mind or for some other reason
was too passive to put a stop to it.
