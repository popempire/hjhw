Roud 4192

This is drawn from a traditional text which is better known as "Tom Dooley",
as recorded by Doc Watson or The Kingston Trio.
The concerned fellow's name, as it was originally spelled, was *Dula*, 
while "Dooley" represents the Appalachian pronunciation of this name.
In this dialect, many names and words ending with "-a" are modified to "-ey" or "-ie".
For instance, "sodie pop" for "soda pop", or "Virginny" for "Virginia".
In his version of this song, Doc also sings of "poor Laurie Foster",
whom we recognize as *Laura* Foster.

The tune is our own variant of "Little Margaret" and has not been used for
this text before.

The Kingston Trio had a hit with their version of this song. It features a
very fun vocal arrangement in the refrains, but the story seems garbled beyond
recognition. One might have expected the Kingston boys to have done better here,
as they do in fact hail from the same county where the story took place, and so
can claim a legitimate connection to the historical ballad. Doc Watson also 
came from the same county and recorded a version on his self-titled album.
Watson's version has a much simpler arrangement and more repetitive melody,
but maintains more historical detail.

The Kingston Trio introduce the song with a spoken monologue, claiming the song
is about "the eternal triangle", i.e. a love triangle which they state involves
Tom Dooley, "a beautiful woman" (presumed to be Laura Foster), and a Sherriff
Grayson.
