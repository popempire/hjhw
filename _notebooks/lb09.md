    60s rock n roll song

    swing on by baby!
    swing by anytime
    swing on by baby!
    swing by anytime

    ================

    hey everybody
    welcome to my master plan

    teacher said you coulda been president
      but you sleep too late, man!
    makin money checkin off the days of the week
      well that ain't your fate, man!
    ...
      yeah well that's just great, man!

    ================

    Now we're postmodern
    post punk
    post post office
    post conscious
    post war
    post metaphysical
    and we're depressed
    'cause our baby's not just ours anymore

    =================

    stay calm now
    don't hurry
    there's no one inside

    God save us
    new magic

    stand straight now
    walk forward
    there's nothing to fear

    you been digging in a dirt mine
    you been hiding from the light
    let the darkness be gone now
    and let the sinners be cleaned

    God bless you
    God keep you
    i've seen where
    i've seen where this goes

    =================

    i wish i were tormented by all this
    a bit of pity would do me a world of good in hell

    you're so perfect like a snowflake on tv
    like a crystal lattice
    maybe if i were a jerk i could steal a girl like you
    as jerks do
    but the polite sinners are already in hell
    the polite sinners

    if you haven't figured it out yet
    think harder
    if you haven't reached heaven yet
    build something taller

    =================

    I put the birds on the wire to tap the CIA
      are you biting the bait, man?
    I put the oceans on the coast to stop the USA
      well it's a bit too late, man!

    well everybody
    welcome to my master plan

    learn to draw the line between the suicides
      and the martyrs, man!

    =================

    gotta get your mind before your mind gets you
    gotta get the world before the world gets you

    =================

    do what you love to do, boy
    yeah well you don't love what's good
    you just love to feel good

    =================

    I wanna see your naked eyes
    like the holy relic of a sinless age

    =================

    I picked my poison and the poison is me

    I kicked the habit and the habit kicked me

    I got the world before the world got me

    I wanna die on a sunny beach
    (with the ocean just out of reach)
    like a whale

    I wanna die with a funny smile
    like a conversation

    I wanna go with a bang
    like the human race
    i wanna die in the cold of outer space

    =================

    Would you eat a crocodile
    just to prove that you love me true?
    would you walk across the nile
    just to prove that you love me true?

    Have a lot of fun
    never met a one like you

    ==================

    Dream pop dreams
    and everybody screams
    and cherry cola funk
    and spaceball spunk

    ==================

    the passion of youth
    that makes you old before your time

    my ideal is a certain cool
    like a temple with a swimming pool
    like a rubber duck in a sacred pool

    ==================

    Just another whitewashed boy
    wanna play the blues

    wanna play the blues so bad
    play the blues so bad

    I carry me on my back
    monkey in my shoes
    i carry me on my back
    monkey in my shoes

    ==================

    That soft suburban smile
    give me the creeps

    slave to comfort
    serve your master well
    he will reward you with a room
    in a thin black padded box

    ==================

    You're still just a stranger
    to this lonely wheel

    ==================

    He ain't no square
    he's all rock n roll hair
    he's all motorcycle chair
    and he's never always there

    no one ever knows
    just where the hell he goes
    when he goes
    and he goes

    he's got no home
    he's everywhere he goes
    when he goes
    and he goes

    spiny creeper with a fish for an eye
    lookin always for a new way to die

    ==================

    All these people feel like me
      bleed like me
      dream like me
    and all these people live like me
      die like me
    children of the universe like me

    ===================

    Watch out for the wheels
    and the chrome appointed heels
    Yeah you love the way it feels
    but you know it never heals

    ===================

    I got seventeen,
      that's what i mean

    I can't move them mountains

    ===================

    The world is all just crumblin
    and i'm singing this song
    Jesus gonna hit you like an atom bomb
    people gettin worried like the folks in japan
    welcome to my master plan

    ====================

    Lady Sadie, you're my word of wisdom
    you're the spell that binds me silently
      a million orisons
      a million twilight suns
    ...

    =====================

    Everything is black inside your head
    but a light shines out your eyes

    =====================

    The lines of Eisenhower's highways
      the railroads and the skyways
    have sunk in the face of this old, old world
    just like the fast lane's a kick
    like the clock is a tick
    in the brain to keep you young
      like every magic spell they've sung
    because age is a killer
      in every other age too

    =====================

    Back home there were seven
      spheres of heaven
    now it's all just outer space

    =====================

    I see all them fuckin hipsters
    in thei hipster pants
    playin hipster music
    for thei hipster dance

    don't let no one tell you
    that punk isn't dead
    cause everybody knows
    that punk is dead

    =====================

    love
    my passionate love
    my desperate dove
    just a drop in the flood

    =====================

    You know how to deal
    spin it like a wheel
    angels up in heaven know how you feel
    come on
    feel it in your toes
    and your powder sugar nose
    come on

    ======================

    Nothing but the glory train

    when everyone's alone, no one is
