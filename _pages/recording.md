### notes

it is the peculiar privilege of all living things to die

recording is a way of preparing for death

one lives not *denying* death but *defying* death

this way of life welcomes death into the warm embrace of combat

obsession is necessary and useful for recording work

a mind prone to fixating on small problems
is suited to certain aspects of recording work

## 1 historical context

### 1.1 mechanical recording

Capturing sound waves passing through the air in a solid medium first became
a practical reality in the late 1870s. The device which made this possible was
called the *phonograph* and was invented by Thomas Edison—the inventor of the
lightbulb. Earlier devices had been able to capture some physical recording of
the soundwaves, but had no way of playing the recorded sound back again.
The phonograph was able to do both, and this ability is what marks the essential
turning point and the birth of audio recording as we know it.

The recording medium of the phonograph was originally a cylinder, which
was later replaced by a disc.

### 1.2 electrical recording

*This is where the microphone enters the picture.*

At first, there was no method for amplifying sounds either for recording or
for playback. Recording onto a cylinder or disc was achieved directly by the
force of the soundwaves vibrating a stylus which etched a groove into the
medium. This required a fairly loud signal in order to create a usable
recording. Playback volume was similarly limited. Additionally, if you wanted
to create multiple copies of a performance, there was often no other options
but to set up multiple phonographs to record it, or perform the same piece
many times. In fact, professional recording artists in these earliest days
would often perform the same piece dozens or even hundreds of times, set up
in front of a battery of phonographs.

### 1.6 where we are now

As we consider where we are now in the ongoing historical development of
audio recording as a technical process, note that we are not particularly
concerned with the biggest changes facing the commercial recording industry.
Recordings are made today in much the same way whether they will be
distributed as compact discs, streaming mp3s, vinyls or anything else.

What has changed somewhat is that the equipment necessary for multitrack
high-fidelity digital audio recording has become much more accessible. The
trend towards increasing power and availability of a technology over time is
very common. Within the last 30 years or so the availability of high quality
recording technology has blossomed.

Nowadays, a common iPhone can, with the addition of a couple small and
affordable pieces of hardware, become an efficient multitrack recording
machine. We are still learning what effect such widespread access to audio
recording capability will have on society and the history of audio recording.

## 2 the recording process

### 2.1 WRITING

This is arguably the most important part of the recording process, and also
arguably not part of the recording process at all. Songs have arisen since the
dawn of time, and probably about as long as humans have been keeping records
of anything, they've been keeping records of their songs. But writing a song,
whether it is constructed on paper or in memory alone, is not the same as
recording any particular *sound*. The *song itself* exists prior to sound.

Recording sound is just one way of recording a song (and of course, recorded
sound may not record a song at all). A recording of a song is *one* particular
variation in an infinite range of possibilities. In such cases—when we are
recording *songs*—the song gives the recording its meaning, and the recording
is to be judged according to how well it evokes the presence of the underlying
song (which is an idea, not sound).

Since the song is the measure of the recording's meaning and value, it must
come before the recording. And yet often, since the advent of sound recording,
people have found that the writing and recording processes will intertwine
somewhat. This is because recording itself can be a creative experience, and
can invoke the same muses that rule the making of song and playing of musical
instruments.

### 2.2 TRACKING

After the writing of songs, what we now call *tracking* is the next component
of the recording process to arise. In common use, this segment of the process
might be called simply "recording"—but since we are here using that term to
refer to the entire process of making a record of songs, we will not use it in
this narrower sense. The term "tracking" arose only after multitrack recording
was available, referring to recording audio into the several *tracks* in the
magnetic tape.

This is the phase where audio is captured into the recording medium. In
recording songs, we generally have the case of musicians singing and playing
instruments. This may be one individual or a large ensemble. If an ensemble,
the players may play all at once, or layer up their parts individually. They
may play with headphones on, listening to their microphones, or to a
pre-recorded track, or to other musicians isolated from them, or with no
headphones at all. The audio may come from microphones responding to sound
in the air, or be generated by electromechanical or electronic means (for
instance, an electric guitar or a synthesizer).

Oftentimes a band or performer will make a recording in two or more steps.
First they will record a *backing track*. Then, listening to this backing
track on speakers or headphones, they will record an *overdub* which is
blended with the backing track.

In both phases, just one track might be recorded at a time or many, as in the
case of a large rock band. The recording apparatus, whether an old tape machine
or a modern digital recording interface, will have a certain maximum number
of tracks which may be recorded simultaneously.

In modern recording, the tracking process often involves many steps of
overdubbing. For instance, a band may record a drummer, guitarist and bassist
playing together first of all, forming the rhythm backing track of the song.
Then they may record saxophone and trumpet playing their parts. These horn
tracks are then added to the backing track for the guitarist to overdub a solo.
Then the lead vocals are recorded with the horns and guitar solo in the backing
track. Then finally background vocals and strings are added on top.

### 2.3 MIXING

After all the components of a song have been recorded, the next stage of the
recording process is *mixing*. In this stage, processing, effects and volume
adjustments are applied to all of the individual tracks which make up the
recording. In some cases this may mean nothing more than setting the relative
volume and panning of the tracks to create a sensible balance. In other cases,
mixing may dramatically change the sound of the recorded tracks through
aggressive processing and special effects. The goal in either case is to create
an illusion—to cause auditory phantoms to appear to the listener, to transport
them to a new place in their mind in very much the same way as a good story or
movie.

In some cases this illusion is created primarily through the original tracking.
This is the tradition in most classical and some jazz recordings. The idea is
to set up the microphones carefully and capture the sound of the ensemble in
a very natural way, as if the listener were sitting in the best seat in the
house.

### 2.4 MASTERING

## 3 acoustics—the physics of sound

*Sound* is mechanical vibrations giving rise to variance in pressure in
a medium. Generally, in recording and everyday life, we are concerned
with sound in air—although sound traveling through media such as water, wood,
steel and other substances is also relevant to our everyday experiences.

The air around us has a certain baseline average pressure. This pressure is
constantly pushing on us and everything in our environment, including our
ears and microphones. The average pressure is called *atmospheric pressure*.
If it were utterly calm and silent, the air pressure would remain statically
at this average pressure. However, this is never quite the case in the real
world. The air pressure at a given place and time is constantly changing up
and down around this average value, and *some* of this constant variation is
perceived by us as sound. (Some of it can also be *felt* rather than heard.)

These *air pressure variations* can be understood as being all made up of
regular vibrations at certain frequencies, i.e. sound is a wave. A wave
stretches out in a space and forms a field. This field is constantly
modulating, and may have a different value from any one point on the field to
the next.

Like the waves on the sea, some sound waves will come very slowly
and be wide across, while others will be narrow and bob up and down rapidly.
Wider waves and slower vibrations in the air correspond with lower pitches,
while conversely narrower waves and more rapid vibrations correspond with
higher pitches.

All sound waves are made up of some combination of frequencies. We refer to
these frequencies by their measure in *Hertz [Hz]*. This number represents the
number of times the air pressure oscillates up and down around the average per
second. The human ear is sensitive to frequencies from about 20 Hz to about
20,000 Hz (which is written 20 kHz, in accordance with the metric system).
This means that our ears can detect vibrations in the air occurring 20 times a
second up to 20 thousand times per second. Many things in our world vibrate
at frequencies within this range—our vocal cords being an important such thing.

Every frequency has an associated wavelength, and these are inversely related.
That is, as the frequency becomes greater, the wavelength becomes smaller, and
vice versa. It is not as important to learn the wavelengths of sound waves,
because we almost always refer to them by their frequency names. It is only
important to recognize that for 20 Hz – 20 kHz they range from about
two thirds of an inch to fifty-six feet (or about 17 mm – 17 m in the metric
system). The relevant thing is that these dimensions are comparable in size to
us and the objects in our physical surroundings. Thus the geometry of any
room or space and the particular arrangement of bodies and furniture and other
objects affects the way the waves will bounce around in complex and
hard-to-predict ways.

### A-Z

#### amplifier (amplification)
is an electronic circuit used to *amplify* a signal—that is, to increase the
strength of the signal while maintaining the same waveform.

electrical audio signals often go through numerous stages of amplification
during the recording and playback processes. though a certain austere ideal of
an amplifier would provide perfectly *clean* *gain*, in reality every amplifier
contributes some amount of distortion and noise to the signal. while this is
generally considered an inevitable compromise in the playback process, it is
sometimes desirable for musical or artistic recording purposes.
