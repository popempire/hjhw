what is real will go on though i never fully
the world is mind but it is not my mind
understood, described, put it in words
the world must be thought in order to be,
but what is thought is not in the mind
thoughts are not generally in the mind
what is *is* the difference between what is
the power of the mind and the power of the will
who is my mind

anarchy rehab (anjism)

could i do nothing for even one day?
i think it would be the hardest thing to do

who you are = what you do
who you are = what you make
who you are = what you produce
how much you are worth = the value of what you produce
who = what
you are = they are
you are = i am
value(you) = value(you())
you = nobody
you = one
you = somebody
you = anybody
you = everybody
i = everybody
everybody = nobody
anybody = somebody
anybody = everybody

are you able to indicate *anything* — even that which is indescribable — 
  by means of negation?
let x be defined as that which cannot be defined
what authority could stop you from creating a word with this definition?
how could this word 'x' possibly adhere "stick" to its referents?
as it turns out, speaking about things doesn't require that they be defined
speaking about people doesn't require that they be defined
our language was made more primarily to speak about people than to speak about 
  things
baby's first word is mama

who you are is a certain set of possibilities
a plan that will always fail, at least in some detail
a projection of pure beauty quivering out into the material plane that will 
  never be consummated in its perfect moment
still you would let yourself be led to the slaughtering place
to the altar of your sacrifice
and live no more for yourself but live instead in the bowels of the hungry 
  grinning faithful gathered round
it happens again like this every year

who is love?

love has many senses

love is a fundamental principle of the world, whereby conscious agents observe 
  each other & draw nearer
come in to (stable) relationship with one another

human love is the manifestation of this principle in human social interactions
whereby humans draw into relationship with one another in such a way as to make 
  possible a stable basis for meaning
& it takes some characteristic species-specific shapes..
our evolution as humans has optimized us (& not just our bodies but our 
  perceptual & cognitive systems)
for mating and bringing forth offspring into a new generation
