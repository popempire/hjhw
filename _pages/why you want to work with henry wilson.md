## purpose, mission, meaning

music and storytelling are widely held to have the ability
to heal.
it is said that time heals all wounds. i think that
through music we become psychically integrated into time—that is,
we come to participate in it as an extension of ourselves,
joyfully, with a sense of flow, rather than encountering it as
an enemy or cruel dictator, as we often do.

we believe that music has the ability to heal psychological
and spiritual wounds.
it is one tool in the healer's bag of tricks.
sometimes this is achieved merely through hearing music.
but often, for certain individuals, this healing is
primarily effected through creating music.
the music comes from somewhere deep inside a person,
and seems to demand to find a way out, and expression.
this type of music is a unique gift to an individual—no
other person ever has or ever will receive the exact same
music.
the successful expression of this music gives great relief
to the individual carrying it—not only of the music's own
desire to be expressed, but generally also to the woes and
weariness confronting the individual at the time.

for many reason, however, the music can get "stuck".
many of these reasons are technical or technological hurdles
that can be overcome with the help of a skillful and attentive
guide or technician.

not all music is meant to be shared with others, or recorded,
or to take any electronic form. on the other hand, much of it *is*—and
pushing the expression of music into these modes often greatly
enhances its curative effect.

this is where we come in—this is the service we provide.
we are technicians and guides.

i think the process of making a record can be deeply healing,
in a psychological way. this has been true in my own personal
experience, and i've witnessed it for others.
