This is the most beautiful world I have ever seen.

Who knew how complex to make it? When god looked down from the nothing to see 
the world, who knew what it would look like?

He might have made man the product of simple symmetries.
But he is bent and crooked: concave and finely-structured. 
Very odd, very self-similar.

And when it comes to dimensions and velocities, what might not have been? 
What does the handiwork of god look like?

The duller things of life seem to fade and lose their lustre when I feel like 
this. Career and family, life and death, dogs and cats. I could almost be 
subverted by the arithmetician's cult, the mathematician's deity.

There are just so many layers of everything. 
I would say it is all like an onion, but that analogy is overused, 
and it's not true. 
It is only like many layers of everything. 
The mathematics change so much from layer to layer. 
It is an illusion that they are all the same thing. 
We are not barred from any layer, but everything is different on every layer. 
This is why the mathematics is not the very spoken word of the Ultimate reality. 
This is why we are completely dominated by law and completely free. 
This has something to do with why we speak of 'enlightenment' and 'liberation'.

That analogy is underused, and it's not even true.
