how much good thought is wasted on drugs and trivial diversion, and how much more withers away because there is no suitable medium to record it? nietzsche said something about how much of the german intellect is wasted on beer...


not everyone can understand everyone.


we confuse ourselves when we imagine even that we understand our own thoughts.


consider two people, one speaking english and one speaking zulu. they are not about to understand each other at all, save what rude gestures can intimate. their communication extends to no subtlety at all, at least not of things that exist only in words. where are justice, denominators, principalities, history, kings, climates and gods for them? surely they cannot understand each other, even to determine the day of the week -- and their worlds are completely separate.

nonetheless, one may reply, these two people may employ much the same set of concepts. here and there they may differ in some fundamental way, but if they could only communicate mind-to-mind, circumventing the pernicious medium of language, they could share much in common.

but is this not simply to say, it is possible that a translator could come along who, standing betwixt them, should set all misunderstandings straight. or else by careful and diligent study, the two may come to understand the sayings of the other -- first a few scattered words and phrases, then slowly full sentences and larger and larger expressions. these things we know are possible -- they have been observed many times over in our world. in fact today they are commonplace.

yet at the same time it is always possible that this should fail to occur -- the translator may be held up in some other place, unable to arrive. the process of language learning may break down at any time and give over to war or disease or distraction. it cannot truly be taken for granted that the one man could ever understand the other, but we make this simplifying assumption.

it is a similar kind of simplifying assumption, combined with the confusion of two different images, which we make when we imagine that we ourselves understand our own thoughts. this is another descendant of that worthless strain of platonism in western thought which says a=a. it is wrong to assume that any two humans could unquestionably understand each other. it is a miracle to observe two such beings ever to meet in this way. if one pursues the question far enough, if one magnifies the atomic structure of the interaction greatly enough, one may always find that the understanding of the two departs in some way. their minds coincide only in a circumscribed area, and even this area cannot be fully defined. it is simply that one cannot question everything all the time.

consider the two different images we mash together when we imagine that we understand our own thoughts.

for another to understand me, they must undertake the action which i ask of them in the manner which i intend, or refuse, or they must orient their internal state such that they behave in the future in a manner modulated by the sense and context of my utterance. they may believe me, or disbelieve, obey or disobey, agree or disagree, love or hate -- but all of these require that they understand first. that another person should understand me always solidifies the infinite fluid extent of their possibilities into a set of concrete alternatives. this next seems trivial but it is near the crux of the matter: in general, people behave in a predictable manner, or in one of a set of handful of predictable manners. our minds are evolved to operate in light of and on this principle. this makes it possible or even conceivable that humans should understand one another.

but this is only one version of the story of understanding. it is also an inner mental process -- involving denotation and connotation, interpretation, representation... it is a parade or a pageant in the mind, a christening of the princess to which all the faeries are invited. understanding in this sense may be analyzed without regard to any outward action of a person -- after all, to say that someone understood my command has a different sense than saying "he either obeyed my command or he did not". he might have only understood it and never yet acted. and conversely, the outward performance or non-performance of the specified actions could not fully constitute in itself the understanding of my order. does a computer understand me when i give it instructions? does a car understand me when i press the gas? does a nail understand when i strike it with a hammer? does the sky understand when i dance for it? not in the same way a human does.

but these images are both of limited usefulness, true only in their own particular regions. we combine them quite wrongfully when we imagine ourselves understanding our own thoughts. it is most obvious that we do not often understand our own thoughts from a very objective point of view — we do not see where they come from, or where they lead us. we are frequently unable to predict our own actions — how scandalous for a self-proclaimed rational animal.

we assume that we must understand our own thoughts, and we picture this thought being built up out of various concepts that reside in our mind, and we may be able to put words to it to put it into expression. once out in the world it drifts on a perilous sea — if it is lucky it may be picked up by another and put back together as a thought, though the other is liable to misarrange any number of the parts or, very likely, employ a somewhat different set of concepts. however, we are comfortable in the belief that we first of all understood our own thought. yet when did this ever happen? how could we prove it?

it is better to assume simply that words may arise in a human mind, and take the form of sentences and discourses. that is all that is necessary. then one may add, with qualification, on an empirical basis, that these words generally arise in predictable ways in given settings, and tend to give rise to predictable responses from other animals.

understanding our own mental contents in either an analytical-experiential way or behavioral-objective way are separate things which may not generally occur together at once. saying that we understand our own thoughts gives rise to a damned doubling of our conceptual vision.
