how much good thought is wasted on drugs and trivial diversion, and how much 
more withers away because there is no suitable medium to record it? 
nietzsche said something about how much of the german intellect is wasted on beer...

not everyone can understand everyone.

we confuse ourselves when we imagine even that we understand our own thoughts.

consider two people, one speaking english and one speaking zulu. they are not 
about to understand each other at all, save what rude gestures can intimate. 
their communication extends to no subtlety at all, at least not of things that
 exist only in words. where are justice, denominators, principalities, history, 
 kings, climates, and gods for them? surely they cannot understand each other, 
 even to determine the day of the week — and their worlds are completely separate.

nonetheless, one may reply, these two people may employ much the same set of 
concepts. here and there they may differ in some fundamental way, but if they 
could only communicate mind-to-mind, circumventing the pernicious medium of 
language, they could share much in common.

but is this not simply to say, it is possible that a translator could come along 
who, standing betwixt them, should set all misunderstandings straight. or else 
by careful and diligent study, the two may come to understand the sayings of the 
other u2014first a few scattered words and phrases, then slowly full sentences 
and larger and larger expressions. these things we know are possible — they have 
been observed many times over in our world. in fact today they are commonplace.

yet at the same time it is always possible that this should fail to occur — 
the translator may be held up in some other place, unable to arrive. the process 
of language learning may break down at any time and give over to war or disease 
or distraction. it cannot truly be taken for granted that the one man could ever 
understand the other, but we make this simplifying assumption.

it is a similar kind of simplifying assumption, combined with the confusion of 
two different images, which we make when we imagine that we ourselves understand 
our own thoughts. this is another descendant of that worthless strain of 
platonism in western thought which says a=a. it is wrong to assume that any two 
humans could unquestionably understand each other. it is a miracle to observe two 
such beings ever to meet in this way. if one pursues the question far enough, if 
one magnifies the atomic structure of the interaction greatly enough, one may 
always find that the understanding of the two departs in some way. their minds 
coincide only in a circumscribed area, and even this area cannot be fully 
defined. it is simply that one cannot question everything all the time.

consider the two different images we mash together when we imagine that we 
understand our own thoughts.

for another to understand me, they must undertake the action which i ask of them 
in the manner which i intend, or refuse, or they must orient their internal 
state such that they behave in the future in a manner modulated by the sense and 
context of my utterance. they may believe me, or disbelieve, obey or disobey, 
agree or disagree, love or hate — but all of these require that they understand 
first. that another person should understand me always solidifies the infinite 
fluid extent of their possibilities into a set of concrete alternatives. this 
next seems trivial but it is near the crux of the matter: in general, people 
behave in a predictable manner, or in one of a set of handful of predictable 
manners. our minds are evolved to operate in light of and on this principle. 
this makes it possible or even conceivable that humans should understand one 
another.

but this is only one version of the story of understanding. it is also an inner 
mental process — involving denotation and connotation, interpretation, 
representation... it is a parade or a pageant in the mind, a christening of the 
princess to which all the faeries are invited. understanding in this sense may 
be analyzed without regard to any outward action of a person — after all, to say 
that someone understood my command has a different sense than saying "he either 
obeyed my command or he did not". he might have only understood it and never yet 
acted. and conversely, the outward performance or non-performance of the 
specified actions could not fully constitute in itself the understanding of my 
order. does a computer understand me when i give it instructions? does a car 
understand me when i press the gas? does a nail understand when i strike it with 
a hammer? does the sky understand when i dance for it? not in the same way a 
human does.

but these images are both of limited usefulness, true only in their own 
particular regions. we combine them quite wrongfully when we imagine ourselves 
understanding our own thoughts. it is most obvious that we do not often 
understand our own thoughts from a very objective point of view — we do not see 
where they come from, or where they lead us. we are frequently unable to predict 
our own actions — how scandalous for a self-proclaimed rational animal.

we assume that we must understand our own thoughts, and we picture this thought 
being built up out of various concepts that reside in our mind, and we may be 
able to put words to it to put it into expression. once out in the world it 
drifts on a perilous sea — if it is lucky it may be picked up by another and put 
back together as a thought, though the other is liable to misarrange any number 
of the parts or, very likely, employ a somewhat different set of concepts. 
however, we are comfortable in the belief that we first of all understood our 
own thought. yet when did this ever happen? how could we prove it?

it is better to assume simply that words may arise in a human mind, and take the 
form of sentences and discourses. that is all that is necessary. then one may 
add, with qualification, on an empirical basis, that these words generally arise 
in predictable ways in given settings, and tend to give rise to predictable 
responses from other animals.

understanding our own mental contents in either an analytical-experiential way 
or behavioral-objective way are separate things which may not generally occur 
together at once. saying that we understand our own thoughts gives rise to a 
damned doubling of our conceptual vision.
