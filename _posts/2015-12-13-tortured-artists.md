People often imagine that artists tend towards depression and neurosis by their 
natureâ€”it's a stalk of the same seed from which flowers their creativity. 
Perhaps. But maybe also artists are often depressed and neurotic because they 
live in a society where their craft and creativity is not often highly valued, 
except where it can be exploited for others' gain, and where they are bombarded 
with images and stories of artists who suffer emotional trauma and then become 
rich and famous (or else die as tragic heroes). Maybe artists are, on the 
average, _more_ creative and productive when their work is valued highly and 
they are thriving participants in a supportive community.
