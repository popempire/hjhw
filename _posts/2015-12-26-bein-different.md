The thing that I think is a bit unique and maybe special about my people and my 
culture is that we believe in an ideal sense that everyone is different and 
should be celebrated precisely _for_ being different, even as we celebrate our 
shared experiences. The most important thing to us is to relate to others, but 
also to express identity in an unhindered way.
