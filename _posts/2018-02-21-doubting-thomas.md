doubting thomas —

what one wants to know is not how to replace talk of touching someone's hand with talk of displacement over time of the electron field & such, but to understand why touching this *particular* hand and feeling its realness in that moment can mean the difference between ultimate meaning and meaninglessness, between absolute hope & absolute despair

faith & doubt are aspects of the same archetype

everything in the fundamental reality comes to us in dual composite form, the thing and its "opposite", signifer/signified, obverse/reverse, yin/yang, so on endlessly.. it is unclear whether this reflects some dual structure in the fundamental reality or (my suspicion) a dual structure in our psychic hardware — when all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail — when all you have is a composite dual psychic cognitive structure, everything starts to look like it carries the seed of its own destruction and rebirth within it.

sometimes a number or a solution is seen as unstable and sometimes it is seen as stable. if it is unstable, it is always trying to resolve to some stable number, roll down to an energy minimum. three, for instance, may be seen as a stable number — as when we consider the legs of a stool — two is unstable, four is semi-stable, three is stable. or it may be seen as unstable — as on a date, where the 'third wheel' destabilizes the situation.
