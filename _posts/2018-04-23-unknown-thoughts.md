moral rectitude is a straight line in a space of possibilities

there is one way to be right and an infinite number of ways to be wrong

the probability of doing the right thing is therefore arbitrarily close to 0

whether it is possible to live a perfectly good life — or even just to do the
right thing in a given time & place — is unclear

what is certain is that it is impossible to ~know~ that you’ve done the right
thing or lived a righteous life

"the aim of human existence is happiness"

happiness cannot be measured by our tools because we ourselves are the
instrument of its measurement

happiness cannot be bought or sold — yet happiness is likewise a type of
agreement

if commerce is the exchange of *goods* : these are invariably exchanged with
*bads*

a certain amount of bads with the goods is what you have to take — in this view
the agreement that is being made is fundamentally one with the commercialist and
himself — the consumer agrees within himself

alternatively, an act of commercial exchange can be seen as a kind of lattice of
interaction that helps support a fundamentally human agreement of a different
order

in this case, the exchange is not of goods and bads, but the playing out of
deeply rooted human emotions and the expression of intuitive patterns of thought

we are the unpredictable, and we are everywhere all the time dying in becoming
predictable

money is a game and it’s not fun anymore
