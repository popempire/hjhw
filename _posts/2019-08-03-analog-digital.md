this whole *analog v. digital* thing—

there's a problem in contemporary society's dialog around
electronic music production techniques—including the electronic
tools and techniques used ubiquitously among all genres,
not just in music that is *called* electronic music.
the problem is the recurrence of this analog vs digital debate.

it is only a problem because it is the locus of a misdirection—
an illusion perpetrated upon us by ourselves.

the problem begins with how people think about
*electronic musical instruments*.

 *  an *electric* guitar is not an *electronic* instrument
 *  an electric guitar hooked up to an amplifier *is* an
    electronic instrument

this theorem is based on the premise that the essence of a musical
instrument is (in part) the potential to make a sound that is
considered to be *music* or *musical*.

a traditional electronic musical instrument,
conceived in the ordinary (too narrow) sense,
such as a synthesizer keyboard,
a drum machine,
or a turntable,
does not ordinarily make any desirable *musical* sound
by itself.
these create electrical signals which flow down wires—a
closed loop of electrical current fluctuating in voltage
over time and position
in a way analogous to
a fluid fluctuating in pressure
in an open or semi-open space.
such a device only becomes a *musical instrument*,
as conceived in the most obvious and essential sense,
when attached to some type of *loudspeaker*—a device
that uses electrical power to vibrate the air in a delicate
and highly controlled way.

people debate the merits of analog vs digital signals
but are content to let the loudspeakers be taken for granted.
this is ludicrous.

think of a passage of music played on a violin,
consisting of many notes.
think of one note, consisting of many partial tones.
think of one partial at a particular frequency,
consisting of many sinusoidal cycles.
can you pick up and take out one individual cycle
of a particular frequency component
of a particular note
played on a particular instrument
out of a musical story
that derives its meaning and context from a far-flung
musical way of life?
this is what it is like to identify a particular human individual.
