Do not buy into the lie that Happiness is the goal of life!

===

I'm 31 years old today and I wish I had something hopeful, funny or wise to say, but in fact I only feel hopeless, useless and unrelatable. I am frustrated by the poverty of my capacity to express my sadness and frustrated with the emotional immaturity in myself that binds me to experience it in the first place.

I am old enough to realize that these feelings are lifelong companions, and although aversive they are perhaps not unnatural creatures. I have learned to feel a lot of shame about feeling sad, but really I suspect that's a maladaptive response to something so characteristic of human life.

I think there's a lie going around that happiness is the goal of life. Consciousness began with an incredible blaze of joy and togetherness and we are rising on an immense ocean of sadness and loneliness to quench it. All must end to begin again. Nature teaches us to suffer, grow older, and die. To pursue pleasure and even to be happy are not good or bad, they are just beside the point.

I hope you all have a nice day.

Since at least the Enlightenment, Western philosophy has been haunted by the irresolvability of the singular consciousness, which it takes as the starting point for its investigations. Consciousness has never been singular. (Dreadful to think of, but sometimes it seems like consciousness is headed that way.) Consciousness arose first, necessarily, in the communion of at least two beings.

Speculative theologico-philosophical musingâ€”liberal humanism has been able to integrate, streamline and adapt every importantly useful aspect of orthodox christianity and re-present it in a modern package, except for the central dogma of orthdox christianity, the doctrine of the trinity

Mysticism vs Legalistic Religion

The goal of the one is to participate in divinity through joining one's being with the divine. The other carefully observes the distinction between divine and mortal, fallible.

Christian doctrine achieves the remarkable efficiency of being able to treat both these paths with the same essential maxim: Live as the Christ. Jesus becomes such an ultra-icon that it is easy to see how Christians should so commonly come to articulate the root of their faith as the divinity of Jesus Christ. This is really more of a later refinement and a sidebar to the essential mystery of the Trinity.
