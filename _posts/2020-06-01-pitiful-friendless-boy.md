THE PITIFUL AND FRIENDLESS BOY
==============================

there never was a sadder or more pitiful boy who every lived

there are demons who live in this boy, tall and slender, like vultures. they have
feasted well for many years on the furry little feelings of loneliness, of
having no real friends, that wander about wild in his soul. the vultures have
grown fat & cunning, and they have learned to cultivate these simple, weak &
nutritious creatures. they not only live in the wild, but are also grown for the
fattening of the vultures, who have thus afforded themselves much leisure. but
this leisure has not made them peaceful & easy-going, for instead they have
become jealous and terrified of losing their easy living. they respond with
extreme violence to any threat to their high & mighty well-being. loneliness is
thus nourished & protected in this boy, but only for a little while, up to a young age
when its meat is most tender. feelings of loneliness rarely anymore live out
their full natural lives.

instead, the flesh of loneliness is consumed & becomes the body of the
vulture-demons.
