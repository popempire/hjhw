this is some free advice for theists who are of an intellectual type, for whom apologetics and arguments for the existence of god are personally important. all purely dialectical arguments for the existence of god are useless. the only meaningful proof for the existence of deity takes the form: god is real, god is alive, i have touched them, you can meet them.

the instinct to insist on demonstrations of the logical validity of this or that theistic proof is a false lead. only the most inept proof attempt by a would-be apologist fails to attain logical validity. *the fundamental issue with essentially all intellectual arguments for the existence of god is that they are flat-out unpersuasive.*[^1]

if every logically formalized case for the existence of god and (crucially) for the positive assertion of some proposition about his her or its nature were examined in detail, the critical point would typically be that either certain premises are deeply uncertain or the conclusion does not meaningfully relate to any question of divinity in the life of the one that would be persuaded.

so the advice i have is to remember st thomas. remember that touching is the critical thing in any intellectual relationship with deity.


[^1]: notably, the complementary case is entirely true as well, although with a nuance: deities in general can never persuasively be proven not to exist by any mere line of reasoning, but very specific deities can indeed be persuasively disproven.
