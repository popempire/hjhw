April Fool's Day
----------------

### Day's activities

Harris & I have started a practice of working on our creative professions for a couple hours to start the day on Mondays. This was our third time doing so. Afterwards, to reward ourselves, we went to Morsel & Nosh and got sandwiches and snacks.

### Workout

Gonna start tryna go heavy once a week. This was the first day for that. Just gradually increasing weight, doing sets of no more than 5: probably gonna do 5x5 till I can't, then 3x5, then ramp up to a single 5, then perhaps continue with 3's.

|Lift       |Reps   |Weight |
|-----------|-------|-------|
|Squat      |5x5    |139    |
|DB Bench   |5x5    |54     |
|DB Curl[^1]|10     |24     |
|           |8      |24     |

[^1]: Strict curl, back against the wall, with [weight] DBs in each hand. Weights begin at thighs and are lifted all the way up to chest/shoulders.

### Solar Eclipse

A total solar eclipse passes thru the United States today. Cincinnati isn't quite in the path of totality, but it's very close. We experienced about a 98-99% eclipse here at around 3:09-3:11 pm. It was kinda cool. Everything got dim for a few minutes, and the birds were chirping excitedly.

### Workout

|Lift       |Reps   |Weight |
|-----------|-------|-------|
|Squat      |5x5    |159    |
