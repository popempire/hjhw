I've been feeling sick since yesterday. I worked today even though I feel 
slightly worse than yesterday. I haven't really rehearsed for the show which
is tomorrow, because I feel so fatigued. This is increasing my anxiety.

I think this writing habit is starting to have some positive mental effects.
I look to it as a somewhat comforting exercise. I'm getting to the point where
I can untangle some actual thoughts, more than just rambling about the awkward-
ness of sitting down to write. It reminds me of when I was a teen, and I felt
that I could be safe anywhere, as long as I had my notebook.

How can a notebook make me feel safe? I wonder if I could find any of my old
reflections on this. One of those things that sticks in my mind, for no 
obvious reason, is a memory of writing about this very thought in my notebook
some day at NHCC (I think?). I was alone, sitting at a table, waiting for 
someone I believe. Probably Ben Walker.

This memory leads me to another memory. One time that I called on Ben Walker 
in his office. I had probably set up a time to meet with him â€” I don't recall
him holding regular "office hours", though perhaps he did. In any case, it may
have been the only time I met with him one-on-one in his office. That wasn't 
our typical venue. Generally we would be In the youth group classroom/common 
area, or else out somewhere in the world. But on this day I met the youth 
pastor in his office for a private conversation. All that I remember of our
conversation was asking him questions about how to compose drum parts for 
songs. Ben was a drummer, among the many other things he was, and that is the
capacity in which he had particularly important insights for me such that I had
to have a clean shot to hear them transmitted clearly.

The things I remember him telling me: Drum patterns are generally about the 
interplay of kick drum and snare (this was the essential clue that I was 
hoping for, as obvious as it seems now, in the context of the Popular Style);
and that I should get in touch with one Josh Gulley, who was a sometimes 
member of the youth group and who was musically gifted, who was composing
symphonies on his computer (*sometimes* because he was so reserved that he
rarely came out in groups or talked to anyone if he did).

I still primarily interpret most drum patterns in terms of the interplay 
of kick and snare. I did get to know Josh Gulley, and I might still have a 
couple CDs he gave me of his symphonic compositions rendered via PC MIDI
libraries of the mid 2000s.

Harris is so sweet. They made me dinner tonight and bought me Skyline last 
night, to help nurse me back to strength. They said to me, I wish I had 
magic healing powers. I told them, You do.

**Apple Spice** syrup evokes memories of fresh baked apple pie. Made from 
fresh apples with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and ginger, it adds a wonderful
warming sweetness and makes any drink taste like Autumn in a cup. Try an Apple
Spice Latte or Apple Spice Chai Latte.
