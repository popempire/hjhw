Oof, two weeks with no writing.

It is the trick or treat hour here in Carthage and Elmwood Place. I've had so
many children that I've had to refill my candy bowl numerous times only halfway 
through the alotted two hours. All the chocolate is gone now — it's just 
dum-dums and bonbons from here on out.

### Transduction

**_Transduction_** is the process of converting energy from one form to another.
For example, *microphones* and *loudspeakers* are both transducers – more 
precisely, integrated sytems whose most essential components are transducers.
One converts *acoustic* energy into *electrical* energy.

#### Transduction as Sacrifice

So many of the most ancient sytems of Myth convey that greatness requires a 
sacrifice, and that appropriate sacrifice shall be rewarded.

### Confidence

I've begun to ask myself, how would I behave if I felt that I knew with 
reasonable confidence that my instinct has and will continue to lead me on the
right path? that I am on the right path?

I run the risk of being mistaken. To err is human — surely sometimes my instinct
would misguide me. If I behave with unshaken confidence, I would misjudge those
circumstances where I erred. It would be unfortunate for confidence to get in
the way of recognizing my mistakes, and thus becoming able to learn from them.

On the other hand, in many cases, it doesn't really matter whether I believe my
action to be right or whether I fret. Generally, the latter option only
increases the amount of energy I have to spend on my anxiety and does not 
improve my situation in any other way.

In fact, my primary motivation for trying this confidence experiment is the 
potential upside of relieving that anxiety which already consumes a considerable
portion of my energy. And granting that there is definitely such a thing as too
much confidence, it seems plausible that a balance between confidence and 
[*the opposite of confidence*] is ideal, and plausible that I tend to live on
the opposite side of equilibrium.

If this intuitional motivation can indeed be called plausible, however, it must
be refined to stand up to a closer scrutiny. What is the opposite of confidence?
and is it likely that I lack confidence (or possess its opposite)?

What I experience which motivates me to try to alter my habits of thought is the
persistent discomfort of anxiety. Particularly, my anxiety seems to relate to my
perception of my social standing among my peers, or to the rightness of my 
courses of action — past, present, or future. (Kind of a broad field.) This 
anxious discomfort, when it relates to my courses of action, is what feels like
the opposite of confidence. More accurately, I should say that what I imagine to
be the inverse or absence of this feeling is what I am calling *confidence*.

Given this definition, I think it is indeed very plausible that I lack
confidence, or more accurately *feel anxiety about my courses of action*. Enough
that it bothers me. Yet in everyday language, I'm not sure that these things
are quite opposites. At least when we review from a social perspective, to 
behave with confidence doesn't really specify anything about interior
experiences. It only requires that one's actions are self-directed and focused
on potential upsides rather than potential downsides. Someone could spend a 
considerable amount of time contemplating that they might be mistaken, weighing
the potential costs of misjudgement, and still act confidently; someone could
spend very little time, no time at all, considering what they might have gained
by trusting their instinct, and still possess a lack of confidence.

Rewriting my initial question:

> How would I behave if I felt that I knew with reasonable lack of anxiety that
> trusting my instinct is the right path to take? that it is the path I have 
> taken, and that is has got me to the right place so far?

I think now some of this word salad can be collapsed:

> How would I behave if I had a reasonable lack of anxiety about trusting my
> instinct?

Now the battle with anxiety has taken a new direction. Now the question is,
whose Instinct are you trusting? The characteristic experience of being an
intelligent life form is of competing trains of thought. In one legitimate but 
overly literal sense, every behavior is according to our instinct. I thought 
someting was the right move at one time, but now I'm not so sure. This is the
typical shape of my anxious thoughts. And it's a fair question. How can you
know that you are following God's path? how can you know whose voice that is in
your heart's ear, whether you believe the ultimate authority to be God or Self?

The true believer is inclined to say here, *I just know!* and naturally the 
skeptic is unconvinced by this.
