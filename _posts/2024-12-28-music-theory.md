title: Octave Equivalence
---

__Octave equivalence__ is a musical practice where tones of a given frequency
are considered to be interchangeable with any other tones whose frequency is the
same frequency multiplied by a binary power. A tone of 440 Hz could be inter<wbr>
changed with tones at 880 Hz (x2), 1.76 kHz (x2<sup>2</sup>), 220 Hz (x2<sup>-1</sup>), 110 Hz
(x2<sup>-2</sup>) and so on. Musicians refer to any such tone of a specific group with a
common __note name__, such as *C*, *B-flat*, *do*, *fa*, or *sol*. This gives us
the notion of a __pitch class__. This class selects all the tones which are 
related to each other by octave equivalence. In practice, this grouping is 
"fuzzy", in the sense that it gathers together all the tones that are exact
multiples of the given base frequency, but also all the tones that are pretty
close to those frequencies. Musical convention dictates how far away from the 
"ideal" frequency a tone can be and still be considered to belong to the
relevant pitch class.

By assigning pitch classes to a small number of frequencies lying between an
arbitrary initial value and twice that value, the entire spectrum can easily be 
divided up into named regions. In musical terms, by giving note names to a 
handful of tones within an octave—i.e. by defining a scale—we can identify or 
specify a note of any frequency.

This relative frequency range that figures centrally here, the span from 
frequency *f* up to *2f*, is called an __octave__ because, historically, 
musical theorists typically assigned seven pitch classes within this span, and
thus with the eighth (Lat. *octavus*) they had reached a note that was equivalent
with the first. These seven pitch classes were specified at uneven distances,
and multiple different patterns of note assignment were used for different 
musical pieces (rarely within the same piece). It was found, however, that by
assigning twelve notes at approximately equal spacing across the octave, all
of the many variations in use (and more) could be represented as a subset of the
master set. This simplification has proven to be astoundingly useful, and in 
this work as well as all conventional modern music, the octave is always divided
into twelve pitch classes at approximately equal intervals.

Note that this system does not *require* modern Equal Temperament (ET), where
the interval between two adjacent notes is always exactly the same. It is well-<wbr>
suited to this temperament, however, and almost all modern instruments are 
designed with this standard in mind.

Also note that this entire system of octave equivalence represents a theoretical
simplification that reflects a certain musical practice which is useful and
appropriate only within a certain musical context. Most musical instruments have
a range of only two to four octaves, and within this range octave equivalence
can be a valid concept; or similarly, within the range of compositions arranged
for traditional SATB voices. It is a simplified, shortened version of the true
underlying equation that reflects the musical reality—and yet musical theorists 
are prone to treating the concept of octave equivalence as if it were a deeper
truth than the nitty gritty musical practice which underlies it. However, if we
restrict ourselves to talking about the typical range of frequencies used in 
typical human song and produced by conventional instruments, octave equivalence
will be an extremely useful concept.

The standard musical note names using the letters A–G along with the modifiers 
"sharp" and "flat" are generally used to refer to pitch classes related to 
specific frequencies defined by convention. The contemporary convention is to
set A equal to 440 Hz and derive all the other pitches from this. However, in
music it is often the ratio or interval between notes which is much more 
important than the absolute value of those notes. Therefore, sometimes it is 
useful to refer to various pitch classes or groups of pitch classes without
specifying exactly what frequencies they are supposed to represent, merely the
relationships between them. For this, my convention is to use the numbers 0–11,
enclosed in curly braces: {0}, {1}, {2} and so on. Typographically, it would be
very convenient here to have single-digit representations of {10} and {11}.
We could use something akin to hexadecimal notation as used in computer
programming, but {A} and {B} would invite too much confusion with the musical
note names. So for now, I know of no better alternative to using {10} and {11}.

Groups of notes can be easily represented in this notation by separating the
pitch classes with commas within a single set of braces: {0,4,7}. More 
fundamental and ultimately more useful than __chords__ is this concept of a 
__pitch class group__ or __set__; chords, in fact, are simply a subset of these
sets.

Chords and similar harmonic notations are useful and true to the extent that
they specify what a musician should play but also fail to specify *exactly* what
a musician should play.

Musical analysis commonly involves lots of repetetive, rudimentary counting, as
well as numerical representations of melodic and harmonic components like the
notation above. This leads some people to remark that "music is a lot like math"
or even that "music is math". Music is not at all like math. Music is like 
Nature, and math is very frequently the best linguistic tool that we have for
describing Nature. Combinatorically, it would make sense to say that given twelve
pitch classes per octave, there are eleven distinct dyadic harmonies possible
(which indeed is true), that there are one hundred and ten distinct triadic
harmonies possible (which is dubious), and that there are nine hundred and ninety
tetradic (four-note) chords possible (which is musically preposterous).
The problem is that is that we are not fully accounting for how human hearing 
resolves and identifies simultaneous pitches. Furthermore, our musical practice 
is so intertwined with memory that we will always tend to use whatever set of 
symbols (patterns, habits) is most efficiently available to our memory. 
These factors confine the number of musically meaningful pitch sets of triadic 
and higher order to a reasonable magnitude, such that these sets, for the most 
part, can be enumerated in named lists represented by a relatively compact set 
of symbols.
