title: Octave Equivalence
---

__Octave equivalence__ is a musical practice where tones of a given frequency
are considered to be interchangeable with any other tones whose frequency is the
same frequency multiplied by a binary power. A tone of 440 Hz could be inter<wbr>
changed with tones at 880 Hz (x2), 1.76 kHz (x2<sup>2</sup>), 220 Hz (x2<sup>-1</sup>), 110 Hz
(x2<sup>-2</sup>) and so on. Musicians refer to any such tone of a specific group with a
common __note name__, such as *C*, *B-flat*, *do*, *fa*, or *sol*. This gives us
the notion of a __pitch class__. This class selects all the tones which are 
related to each other by octave equivalence. In practice, this grouping is 
"fuzzy", in the sense that it gathers together all the tones that are exact
multiples of the given base frequency, but also all the tones that are pretty
close to those frequencies.

Musical convention dictates how far away from the "ideal" frequency a tone can
be and still be considered to belong to the relevant pitch class. By assigning
pitch classes to a small number of frequencies lying between an arbitrary
initial value and twice that value, the entire spectrum can easily be divided up
into named regions. In musical terms, by giving note names to a handful of tones
within an octave—i.e. by defining a scale—we can identify or specify a note of
any frequency.

This relative frequency range that figures centrally here, the span from 
frequency *f* up to *2f*, is called an __octave__ because, historically, 
musical theorists typically assigned seven pitch classes within this span, and
thus with the eighth (Lat. *octavus*) they had reached a note that was equivalent
with the first.
