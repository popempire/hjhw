Social Anxiety
--------------

There was a time in my life when I realized that I experience social anxiety.
A period of a couple weeks or so wherein I became aware that an identifiable
bouquet of experiences and behaviors were familiar to me and had indeed been
affecting my life in mostly negative ways. I can look back before this time and
recognize foreshadowings of this realization, but my social anxiety remained
an entirely unobserved entity within my psyche, even if some of its effects were
observed. Since that time, it seems so obvious as to rarely warrant mention. The
experience of the transition between these mental worlds was significant enough
to prompt me to remember that mental state in between, as well as to consider
that there may always be more realizations that loom large in the unconscious.
