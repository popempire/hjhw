title: preface for a collection of songs

I should like to appear before you as Oz the Great and Terrible, manipulating the
levers and dials of your psyche with awesome power.
Songcraft, like it's children Playing an Instrument and Mixing Audio, is an art
of illusion.

My malevolent desire for control prevents me from maintaining the facade and 
forces me to pull back the curtain. I insist on tampering with the context in 
which you perceive these songs.

The essence of magic is moving past illusion.
It turns out I am just a lonely old man.
