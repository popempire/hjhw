There is abundant evidence that I am following an effective path to fruition.

There's Harris: Harris is objectively the most pleasant person ever to have in 
company, and she loves living with me. She is such a remarkable person and such
an ideal companion, and she is devoted to me. 

I own a home. True, I owe a hundred thousand dollars to the bank at this point,
but I have methodically improved the quality and security of my home year after
year.

I have removed essentially all of the impediments to my pursuit of my creative
endeavors, particularly music, besides lack of excess wealth. I am
understandably dubious about this last advantage anyways.

My primary work, while not affording me excess wealth, does leave me with 
meaningful time and mental energy to pursue the things I really want to do to 
enjoy my life and leave an imprint on the world. It also provides me a measure
of social fulfillment and creative stimulation, while it has the potential to
provide me with important opportunities and connections in the future, at least
towards the goal of opening a cafe/club of my own.

My community lacks a credible sober-first all-ages venue. My cafe/club could 
be that. How best do I aim to make consistent income to support that function?
