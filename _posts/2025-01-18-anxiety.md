Much (most?) of my anxiety is focused on my perceived social standing among my 
fellow humans. For us, as social, intelligent creatures this anxiety is 
practically unavoidable. Obviously, our social standing is crucial to our 
thriving as creatures.

â€” But then again, it's actually only a little bit important, one of many other 
important factors. At least, the preponderance of what I get anxious about, 
socially, doesn't really matter that much to my quality of life. If I were 
ostracized from my community with no food or shelter, it would be different, and 
social standing would matter a lot. That is hardly my situation. The important 
baseline of social standing I need is highly secure, it is not in my nature to 
undo that. Yet due to my typical human psychic bias, it is very hard to turn off 
my anxiety about my social standing in every circumstance.
