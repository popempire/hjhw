History of Pop Empire
-------------------------

### Major events

  - __2006-2007__ Henry's senior year of highschool he takes a literature class
    at the Learning Tree Co-op taught by Cameron Cochran
  - __2007__ Henry makes a compilation of home demo recordings and distributes
    it to a handful of friends, including Cameron. The collection is titled 
    "*Twirling*".
  - __2008__ Henry makes another compilation of home demos, calling it 
    "*Some Odd Numbers*". Even fewer copies of this were made, but again one
    was given to Cameron
  - __2009__ Cameron is approached by an admirer of
    his recent work with the project **The Sheds** (*q.v.*) 
    with an offer to financially underwrite his (Cameron's) next recording project.
    Cameron reaches out to Henry with the idea of creating a collaborative duo.
  - __2009__ Cameron and Henry collect an assortment of both of their recent 
    song ideas and begin passing them back and forth (as Ableton Live sets) for
    further development
  - __2009__ Over a couple of weekends, Cameron and Henry decamp to the home of
    their patron [his name?] where an old secondary building on the property
    [it wasn't just a garage — what was it called?] had been emptied out and 
    fixed up nice and where they set up a humble but effective recording space.
    They record two songs in these sessions: 
    "*City Girl + City Boy*" and "*Some Fun*".
  - __2009__ Divorce proceedings cut of the financial support that had prompted
    the project. Crucially, however, Cameron and Henry decide to carry on with
    their conceived collaboration.
    They take up the recording process in the nurse's cabin (a trailer, at that 
    time) at Camp Ernst, where Cameron's wife Elizabeth (Eli) was director
  - __2009__ Cameron and Henry complete their first collection of songs which
    they title *Rainy Child*.
  - __Feb 2010__ *Rainy Child* is released with a show at The [Original]
    Southgate House, in the Parlor, with The Lions Rampant and The Seedy Seeds.
    There is an artshow on the third floor featuring artwork from the many 
    artist collaborators on the album artwork. The show is sold out.
  - __Nov 2010__ Pop Empire is named "New Artist of the Year" at the Cincinnati
    Entertainment Awards
  - __2011__ *The Devil's Party* is released, the duo's first full-length.
    The majority of the songs are written by Henry this time. The release show
    is at the Southgate House in the ballroom.
  - __2011__ Pop Empire is named "Best Electronic" act at the Cincinnati 
    Entertainment Awards. Drummer Andy Jody, who has just joined the band, 
    appeared onstage along with Cameron and Henry to accept the award.
  - __Jan & Feb 2012__ The trio, brandishing guitar, drumkit, and synthesizer
    (sans PA, laptops, or electronic beats) perform residencies at Motr and 
    The Comet, extending their repertoire into blues, rock & roll, and country
    classics.
  - __2012__ The trio begins recording what was to be their next album at the
    historic Emery Theatre in Over-the-Rhine. They complete all basic tracks
    for about a dozen songs.
  - __2012__ The group takes a break from performing while Henry takes the 
    recordings home to add vocals and work on mixing. Cameron, meanwhile, had
    reconnected and begun playing with his longtime friend, country singer
    Jeremy Pinnell (who had performed as The Lightwires and The Great Depression,
    and was on the cusp of restarting his solo career). Initially through this
    project, Cameron came to play the pedal steel guitar, and he quickly grew
    enamored of the instrument. He decides to set aside guitar in favor of 
    pedal steel. This, however, places Pop Empire in jeopardy — they try a 
    couple practices as a pedal steel - synth - drums trio, yet it is somehow
    clear that that's not going to work. Cameron therefore steps aside from the
    band.
  - __2013__ Henry recruits guitarist Ryan Back, though Andy Jody follows 
    Cameron and departs shortly after. Henry and Ryan return to the group's
    stylistic origin as a guitar + electronic beats duo. This year is a slow
    rebuild as the new duo crafts largely all new material for their next album
    and live performances. They experiment with using video projections at live
    shows.
  - __Sep 13, 2014__ *Future Blues* is released. This had been the working title of the 
    Emery Theatre recording sessions as well. The release show is at Motr, and
    drummer Jake Langknecht is in attendance.
  - __Oct 3, 2014__ Jake joins Ryan and Henry to perform at Bogart's in the first
    show of Pop Empire's second trio.
  - __2015__ The trio begin a more active show schedule, including getting out
    of town for single-night runs
  - __Late 2015__ The trio begin recording "demos" which will become 
    *The Violent Bear It Away* in their practice space (in About Space,
    Hoffner St, Northside)
  - __May 26, 2016__ *The Violent Bear It Away* is released with a show at 
    Ice Cream Factory (the home/studio/venue of Paul Coors, in Brighton)
  - __June 2016__ The trio embark on their first multi-day tour. However, Ryan
    is unable to complete the tour for psychological reasons, and the band has
    to drop off of their final show on the tour, in Lawrence KS. Henry and Jake
    continue on to Lawrence and attend the show, while Ryan departs separately
    and returns home by airplane.
  - __August 2016__ The trio set out for a three-day stint to New York and back,
    but they quickly become a duo as Ryan once again has to abandon the tour
    for psychological reasons. This time, Henry and Jake leave him on the side
    of the road on the outskirts of Cincinnati, guitar case in hand, as it begins
    to rain. The continue on and complete the shows as a bass - drums duo.
  - __2016__ Despite having had to drop out of out-of-town performances twice,
    Ryan wishes to continue with the project and overcome the travel anxiety.
    The band takes only single-night trips for a while to try to build confidence.
    Meanwhile, they record a new single, titled "*Going Down*", and begin to
    plan a tour to support it upon release.
  - __Spring 2017__ Leading up to the planned *Going Down Tour*, Ryan confronts the
    fact that touring is too much of a strain on his mental health, and he
    departs from the band. Henry recruits guitarist Katie Eresman to fill in
    on the upcoming tour.
  - __May 2017__ The tour with Katie goes very well, and she is invited to join
    the band permanently. Jake and Katie hit it off, too.
  
  - __Friday, March 13, 2020__ Pop Empire plays its last show before the infamous
    "Lockdown" of Covid took effect, a house show in Oxford OH (where pre-rolled
    joints were freely passed among the congregants, and everyone breathed on
    everyone).
  - __August 21, 2021__ Performance at Fountain Square, Katie's last show
  - __June 3, 2022__ Performance at Motr, Henry & Jake duo
  - __April 2023__ Residency at The Listing Loon (primarily Jake & Henry duo,
    with some Henry solo)
  - __July 2024__ Residency at Motr
