I love Cincinnati but I believe in the value of honest self-reflection. 
I cannot stand the kind of hometown cheerleading squad attitude that marks a lot
of the public messaging of Cincinnati's own understanding of its art scene.
Yes, you've got to celebrate the good, and you've got to give yourself some
positive encouragement, but we ought to be able to expect more of ourselves
when we clearly miss our potential.

Cincinnati is home to a great number of talented artists of many specializations.
The raw material is there. Yet the city as a whole is committed to de-clawing
any vital art scene before it becomes full grown (like Blink or MPMF). Perhaps
it is the influence of aesthetically conservative (tasteless) corporations such
as P&G, Kroger, and 5/3. The best funded neighborhood development corporations,
led by 3CDC, present themselves as friends to artists and benefactors of the
local aesthetic culture, but their wet dream is always to move every painter,
rapper, and poet out of their home to put a lawyer, banker, or tech bro in their
place.
