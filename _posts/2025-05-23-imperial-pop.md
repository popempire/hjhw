in terms of instrumentation, the hallmarks of the imperial popular style are 
quite definitive: the music is ruled by drums and bass. contemporary domestic 
critics,  culturally accustomed to differentiating between hip hop, country, 
rock, electronic, etc. will sometimes miss the most obvious fact about all of 
them — they are governed by drum & bass.

*the drums* as we are referring to them, i.e. the drumkit, is/are an invention 
of the 20th century (its predecessors were most of its individual components, 
understood as distinct instruments). not all of the essential ancestral strains 
of the imperial style feature the drumkit as such, but if there is any 
instrumental accompaniment, it must speak percussively. *the bass*, whether tuba, 
string bass, electric bass, or synth bass, is not always present as an 
instrument in the ensemble — but if it is not, then if there is any 
instrumentation at all, it must speak also in the bass voice. piano and guitar 
are useful because they are able to fulfill both the requirements of percussion 
and bass, with the added benefit of being simultaneously able to speak in higher 
registers where it may guide or harmonize with a singer.
