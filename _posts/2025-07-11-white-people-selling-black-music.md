### tangent of thought

Vashti Bunyan has an album called *Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind*.
I think it is a very good title, and it is very true.
Some things just stick in your mind. 
For instance, cringy things you did as a teenager.

For me, one of these things was what I wrote in my college application essay.
In explaining that I what I really wanted to do was to play rock & roll music,
I attributed to John Lennon the quote,
"[of rock & roll music], it's got a back beat and you can't lose it."

In retrospect, I shouldn't have been even a little surprised that I was not
accepted to the school I submitted this essay to.
The whole sentiment I was expressing did not reflect the ideals of academic
dedication.
The thing that bothers me, though, as I remember this essay and cringe,
is that I attributed the lyrics of Chuck Berry's "Rock & Roll Music" to John 
Lennon.

Since that time I have been an acolyte of the American Popular Style of the 20th Century,
as indeed I indicated in my essay.
As such, this mistake is, of course, terribly embarrassing. 
Chuck Berry is the black American man who wrote the song and released his
recording of it in 1957.
John Lennon is the white British man who, with his skiffle band The Beatles,
covered the song in 1964.
The Beatles played numerous songs by Chuck Berry, were significantly influenced
by his music — and while they did acknowledge credit to him, and likely raised
his fortunes to some degree with their successful covers of his songs, they 
acquired far more wealth and fame than he ever did from the same music.

The unfortunate thing is that, despite the pang of embarrassment I feel in 
remembering this college application essay, my mistake is not that unusual.
Many, probably most, Americans would attribute significant swaths of the 
American pop music panoply to white musicians which were decidedly originated
by black Americans.
It's not even intentional on the part of the listeners. The white musicians just 
got way more famous for the same music, and so naturally more people heard about 
them. I played with a band once who called themselves *Corrina, Corrina*.
Talking to them after the show, they told me the name was from the Bob Dylan song,
unaware that the namesake song was a traditional, known by hundreds or thousands
of mostly poor, rural singers before Robert Zimmerman aka Bob Dylan recorded it.
That was embarrassing for them because they named their band after the song
without investigating the provenance of the song, just like my misattribution
in my essay was embarrassing because I cited it as a lynch pin of my teenage
philsosphy. However, while these circumstances make our mistakes conspicuous,
they are by no means uncommon mistakes.

For at least 150 years, probably longer, black Americans have had an influence
on our popular music out of proportion with their minority and relative lack of
societal influence. Time and again, part of the way this has played out is with
black composers and performers developing music that a closely following 
generation of white musicians implements and sells to a much larger audience — 
subsequently, they are often remembered as the pioneers of the music that they
inherited. By no means is this cultural transmission wrong in itself, but in 
the context of American history the lack of credit where credit is due is often
egregious and embarrasing. It's note merely stylistic influences that are not
acknowledged — specific songs and compositions of black musicians frequently 
have become so associated with specific white musicians that the cultural
consciousness practically attributes the number to the white ones.

This story has repeated so many times that it has in fact been described already
long ago, and therefore conceptually and culturally aware white artists often
point to their own integration with and influence from black culture as a badge
of quality and authenticity in their work. They humbly brag about playing with
black musicians, or playing the music of black musicians, or at least of being
influenced by black musicians, when such transgression both terrified and
mesmerized their white audiences. (Generation after generation has claimed the
same certificate of authenticity.)

Whole white subcultures, which self-identify as being centered around a certain
aesthetic and ethos, are based around emulation of what seemed cool to black 
and poor white children of some previous generation 20, 30, 50, 100 years ago.

## musical genus and species

Depending on how you count them,
there are several hundred to a couple thousand songs in the American popular 
song ecosystem. I don't call it a canon because nobody defines it and it's much
more encompassing. I mean something like *species of song* when I say "song" here.
Obviously there are millions of songs in the broad sense amongst the vast fields
of American music. But in truth these are not all so many different ways of song,
but variations on the same species of song-way.

If we really mean to employ this biological analogy, 
perhaps instead we should call these *clans* rather than species, because in 
general, any of these hundreds of song-ways could successfully be mated with 
another, even if it never had been before. 

New song-clans can arise at any time, but it has to happen organically. You can't
necessarily set out to write an entirely original and new song and be successful
in the attempt. Even if you did, it's not unlikely that no one would want to 
sing this song for the rest of their life, even you, and the song would die.
This is hardly a problem, however, because songwriters are in fact rather like
gardeners or breeders of songs.
