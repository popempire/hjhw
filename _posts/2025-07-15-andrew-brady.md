You Can't Rule Me  
- Lucinda Williams  
(she played this song at the concert tonight, and in introducing it, she said that it was inspired by Memphis Minnie.)

The thing is, I believe that I could do altogether a better job, given the same resources. I could do that, and I could do it better.

Is this pride? is it jealousy? is it hubris? and if I feel so self-affirmed as all this, why am I ruled by anxiety? why do I have such a hard time living in confidence?

Is it a fearful pride? would I rather imagine in spiteful secrecy that I could exceed the popular stars of the era, but never allow the opportunity for this premise to be tested?

I swear, if I had the chance to play a tour in venues of a couple thousand cap, I would take the chance immediately. I swear I am ready to be tested.

Lucinda played with Brady Blade on drums. He had a kit with just one mounted tom, one floor tom, kick, snare, hi hats, and just one other cymbal. She had a bass player and two guitar players. She sang. Her age (she's 72) showed when she walked (a stage hand was always ready by her side and lit her way with a flashlight when she walked across the stage). Her voice, however, was in excellent form, and her performance was compelling.

I liked how straightforward the band's arrangements were. You can achieve lots of exciting and unexpected sonic textures with a larger ensemble, but I don't think it would ever be musically *necessary* to engage more than that many voices.
