title: Dark Thoughts
---

I've hard dark thoughts lately. When I do, it feels as if some external
voice or presence of mind is interfering with my inner world. In the past,
I had dark thougths also, but then it felt as if the dark thoughts *were*
my inner world, the dark thoughts *were* myself.

I think this late state of affairs is an improvement in my situation,
though it may even be a dehumanization of my spirit — that is, humans seem
to be uniquely psychically capable among the animals of having *dark thoughts*,
or at least unique in having such sustained and creative expressions of 
dark thoughts. After all, *brooding* means something completely different for
animals and for humans.

Most all animals can express *aggression*. Many can almost certainly premeditate
it, and some possibly even envision carnage. These are types of dark 
thoughts, but animals do not seem to linger in them the way humans do. These
thoughts explode into a moment of action, or they go away. But with humans they
can become a whole habitation.

Most animals live in the mental state of the animal which they are in relation
to their environment — a pig lives in the mental state of a pig, a bird of a
bird, a flea of a flea. But a man can live in the mental state of a wounded dog
for his whole life.

So in a way, it is the habit of thinking dark thoughts which makes us human.

Accept that you can't get out of it.
