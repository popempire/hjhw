in true freedom there is no free will

to be truly free means to submit
  - to god
  - to love who is lord of all
  - to nature

to be truly free means to live fully by instinct

thus freedom is un-freedom, submission, slavery â€“ very well. but can you say
the converse? slavery is freedom? it seems perverse to say this

yet what many religions and philosophies teach is that perfect devotion *of a 
certain kind* is the path to true freedom
