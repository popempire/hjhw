I get home from work, and almost immediately I want to turn on some kind of 
video entertainment â€” maybe YouTube, or a show on some streaming service.
It's nice to chill out on the couch after a long shift on your feet, for sure,
but more than that, I want to hear these semi-familiar voices.
It seems as if, after I've been social all day at work, when I get home I am
lonely. I immediately try to stave off the aloneness. It is like an uncomfortable
feeling.

Today's critics are right to point out that the so-called
Great Literature has disproportionately represented the viewpoints of a very
limited and specific demographic: wealthy males, especially older and 
socially or politically advantaged ones. Yet I think the correct response to
this observation is to search in this corpus for the insights which might
particularly derive from this wealthy male vantage point. While of course it is
preposterous to try to summarize any concise list of insights from the general
run of even just, say, classic European or American literature, I am struck by
how often the wisdom passed on from many of literary history's elites is that
money, power, and advantage cannot purchase happiness or goodness; that the
most important experiences in life are mental (or spiritual); that probably the
greatest achievement in life is some kind of mental clarity or orientation.

It is very well for relatively disadvantaged groups and artists to take
inspiration from the struggle for acquisition of the wealth, power, and 
privilege that most of the Authors of Great Literature have: but let them take
heed that these things are not enough, which is apparent because that's the
report from those who have had them.

If it's a public message coming from a living billionaire or their proxy, it 
would be sensible to question whether a teaching that wealth and power are not
the goal of life is in earnest or is a misdirection to manipulate the masses.
Those who benefit from the status quo have a perverse incentive to send priests
out to teach the masses that it is only right to be poor if you're born poor.
On the contrary, I believe this teaching is found in the Classics of Western 
Literature among elite men who were only writing for other elite men.
