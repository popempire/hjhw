The culture and industry of craft cocktails is oriented primarily to Spirits
rather than to Bitters and Liqueurs. This is because the culture, past all of
its pretenses, is oriented towards getting people drunk and taking their money 
for it, rather than towards flavor. To me, it is a little like picking a date
based on who you think is most likely to put out rather than who is hottest.
