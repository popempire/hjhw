Starting is the hardest part. The fear is what makes it so hard. The fear of not
being able to finish. It is already too late, and tomorrow I will have to return
to work.

I wish my innate rationalizations worked in the opposite direction on this: 
the fear of not being able to finish would inspire my immediate action.

I think my vision could improve: I think I can refine my understanding of my own
situation. My situation is not like either of those described above. It is some
more subtle third thing. Everything I want is now in reach, and I hesitate upon
the grasping.
