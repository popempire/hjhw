The *commercialization* of the Imperial Popular Style proceeds on two levels.
On the first level are the people who look at the musical culture fundamentally
as a way to make money. Their motivations are entirely conventional and unoriginal.
The most successful of this sort become very adept at turning the native desires
of artists (especially young ones) for fame, sexual opportunities, and pleasure
towards the end goal of making money. The class of people who really make a
living out of this includes probably only one tenth of one percent of musicians, 
writers, and producers — people directly involved in making music. Most of the
members of this class are seriously involved only in the business of music.
Yet, they have been given free reign to define the cultural perception of *success*
as a musician.

This isn't people who are driven to make music and who manage to make a living by
doing so. This is the people who find in music, i.e. in its associated industries,
an avenue to becoming actually *wealthy*, and for whom this opportunity becomes
the primary motivator, rather than the innate social desire to share music.

The influence of this class of people on its own is not particularly noteworthy.
Sometimes the effect of the desire to exploit musical popularity for wealth is 
overall positive, often it is overall negative. What else would you expect?
You can find these type of people in every neighborhood, who are most interested
in making some money however they can do it with minimum effort and maximum fun.
Their more serious impact comes from how they are easily used as pawns for the
class operating at the second level at which the Imperial Style is "commercialized".

Being an extremely successful musician or record producer generally means you
become a millionaire, cand buy one or more beautiful homes, live a glamorous life,
and be freed from the financial anxieties of the common people. However, it 
very rarely brings anyone up to the rarefied heights of plutocratic wealth.
The few musical artists who might be considered to approach this level —
an Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson, Beyonce, or Jay-Z —
often wind up making the bulk of their wealth not directly from their music but 
from other business ventures, and even then it often seems that their role in
elite society is more as currency among the true aristocrats who gain clout
for hobnobbing with the stars.

This class has no particular concern about the nuances of different genres, nor
about the relative influences of intertwingin musical traditions. Like the true
artists, ironically, they see all the styles of American music as one Imperial
Popular Style. They do, however, have a keen interest in suppressing certain
impulses which are native to every flavor of the Popular Style.

They are pushing again the old obsession with the lives of the elites, the nobility,
the wealthiest members of society, trying to erode the American style's contrary
fascination with the lives of ordinary, poor, and disadvantaged. They suppress
extensive ruminations on death, and flood the zone with images of wealth,
luxury, and sex. They dangle the bait of high social standing and unlimited
mating opportunities as the reward of artistic merit, knowing full well that
in their world entertainers are, at best, never more than expensive servants.

Young people, adolescents and young adults, like all people, tend to love music.
Speaking generally, these are also the people who are most personally interested
in romance and whose experiential framework for romance is under construction.
It is entirely natural that musical memories should become intertwined with their
personal interpretations of their species' mating rituals.

This collection of instincts is being warped into an exercise in consumerism by 
efforts primarily aimed at young people. They have been fed the idea, though it
is not articulated openly, that what they must do to make a play in the mating 
game is to develop a romantic identity, a sexual persona, as a projection of 
their musical taste. 

It seems that the 1950s may be the time when certain elites
first recognized the potential for this opportunity via popular music, not just
to acquire a middling amount of wealth, but to wield real social influence.
Perhaps some had seen it before, but that's when the possibility became undeniable.
The present-day infiltration and integration of music streaming services with
social media is a more mature and insidious mechanism for this influence.

Young people have to carefully consider which musical they shall take to adorn
their sexual identity, and they will surely scrape together all their pocket change to project
this identity for their peers — buying records, concert tickets, merch, etc.
They'll post songs on their social media stories to paint a picture of their inner
romantic world, thinking it costs them nothing, while exposing themselve to
advertisements and handing over detailed information about their psychological
habits to tech companies. In general, the powers that be
are more interested in the money that advertisers bring to the table anyway, 
though they'll take the kids' pocket change too — and cash in again when those
fans are older and more financially stable, by selling the idea that there's no
music that is as special as the music that you loved when you were an adolescent.
(A kitschy nostalgic notion which happens to be an insidious lie.)

The trick is that, for the the young people's efforts at establishing their
musico-sexual *brand* to be successful in their own eyes, they must choose music
which is popular enough to be recognized or understood by other members of their
mating pool, while also being distinct enough to help them stand out from the
crowd. It's a careful balance to be struck, which engages a great deal of mental
effort on the part of the young people. But the game has been rigged. The
music industry has to provide a sufficient variety of artists for people to 
attach themselves to, but it has no need to provide any more than this quota.
The industry has no motivation, for instance, to try to raise the profile of *every*
artist whose work could be liked by lots of people. It only needs enough for
everyone to feel like they have a couple options. One superstar can be more profitable
than multiple minor stars, anyway. And the people themselves don't want *too*
many stars, because they need the stars to be recognizable to others in their
community in order for their association to *signify* something. Just because
I know that Blind Willie Johnson is an incredible slide guitarist, and his music
expresses something about the spiritual depths of my sexual mind, it doesn't
do me any good to show a girl that I have a Blind Willie Johnson record if 
that name means absolutely nothing to her.

The range of artistic expression allowed to persist in the Imperial Popular
Style under the influence of this second level of commercialization is expansive
in aspects that don't matter to the interests of the ruling class, but in other
areas the options are artificially limited. There is no serious critique of 
consumerism, of extreme wealth, of technological progress; only rarely a really 
thoughtful examination of death, and this will get an asterisk next to its
accolades for being *morbid*.

You're free to choose any music you like, but your favorite will be a commercially
viable artist — and only as long as your input into this industry as a consumer
is funneled towards the financial elite's approved industry partners,
the Major Labels. That's the Imperial system — do whatever you like, as long as
you don't try to undermine the system and you keep the money flowing.

Everything I'm saying here involves some amount of generalization, and it is
important to recognize and cherish the exceptions where they exist, such as 
Stevie Wonder. Furthermore, what I have been describing is like a description of
gathering cloud, a mustering invading army — I have been describing the American
Popular Style under the influence of commercialization. But in my heart, I believe
this is only one half of the story, that all of this still hangs in the balance,
and that this music's legacy could still be an enrichment of the truest
human instincts. The final chapters of the story will be written long
after we are dead.

In the interest of more careful consideration of the broad claims set out in
the above paragraphs,
we may examine a couple of traits or characteristic tendencies of the American
Popular Style as I see it, 
which have been [mentioned already]({% link _llotbw/ballads.md %}).
I have the intuition that these signatures of the Popular Style are 
*fundamentally good* in my personal understanding of the world.
I believe that the examples set forth and still living in the American tradition
could inspire great flourishing of artistic expression in every place that
comes under the influence of the Imperial Style, which is practically everywhere.
Further, I have the intuition that these songs, these histories and traditions
of sharing and repeating songs with each other spanning over centuries,
are under threat of being domesticated and constrained by plutocratic interests.

The examples I examine here are in no way meant to be construed as a comprehensive
survey of the literature that is relevant to this discussion.
