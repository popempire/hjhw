    My mind
    Has no answer to the world 
    But blue
    Eternal skies of wonder

    I make the stars
    A billion miles wide
    Just to show
    How big our love could be 

    You're strange 
    Child are you my kind?

    No words
    Disclose the hearts design 

    Your mind
    Is a fountain of new secrets 
    Heart is blue
    Eternal skies of wonder

    No words disclose the heart's design 
    I am blue—eternal skies of wonder
    My mind has no answer to the world 
    You're strange–child, are you my kind?

    Your voice was the first thing that I loved
    It called me from a distant room
    Your face was the next thing that I loved
    I bear no injury against it lightly

    The mind
    Serves no portion of disaster
    The heart
    Bids on a haunted doll

    Combined
    Loves no other living master 
    Apart
    Feeds on a service call

    Refined
    Rubbed smooth as alabaster 
    A part
    Reads all no witness wall

    The mind
    Serves no other living master 
    No words
    Disclose the heart's design

    Your voice 
    Was the first thing that I loved
    It called
    Me from a distant room

    Your face
    Was the next thing that I loved 
    I bear
    No injury against it lightly 

    I've walked 
    The mansion of your mind 
    You're strange 
    Child are you my kind?

    I've searched 
    But never found the answer 
    Are you 
    Also just a visitor?

    And love
    Love is not an answer 
    But some
    Wide eternal field/space of wonder

    And love 
    Love is not an answer 
    But blue 
    Eternal skies of wonder


    One thing 
    I ask of you before 
    I too
    Shall succumb to madness

    I learned truth 
    From the stories you told me
