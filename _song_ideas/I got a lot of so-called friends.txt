I got a lot of so-called friends 

That's tryna give me the bait
They don't like me but they know me 
Cause they seen me hangin around 
I don't roll my bones forever 
Little girl that gets on down 
I got patience by the minute 
I don't want them hangin around 
But she's coming up round the backside honest 
Taking a sample checking for pulse 

There's a lot of snakelike men
That's try to sell you the hook
It ain't fear that is the answer 
And it ain't wrote down in a book 
I'm so {[fed|f'ed] up [with|on]} pictures 
Gonna take my own advice 
Gonna get me religion 
Lighthouse on the hill
She looks good enough for Jesus surely 
Good enough for me 


I know their secret voices whisper 
Truly I am alone 
They speak all of liberation and fly a flag over all the world
Yet everywhere man is divided against man 
And free he never is from himself 
The wanting creeps up slowly 

I am alone and I shall die 

Make a wasteland call it peace 
[DC hardcore history wrath of the khans]

B.

[I am not|and you're] afraid 

And your love
Is it one love
Or is it many?

I am poor sir
But I'm thrifty
I got everything I need 

You know the Son light up the daytime honey
So too surely Daughter the night 



I got a lot of so-called friends 
That's tryna give me the bait
They don't like me but they know me
'Cause they seen me hanging around 
They got faith in their government 
And they don't trust their friends 
Lord they're so fucked up on pictures 
I'm gonna take my own advice 
Good enough for Jesus surely 
Good enough for me 

There's a lot of snakelike men
Tryna sell you the hook
But it ain't fear that is the answer 
And it ain't wrote down in a book
They make a wasteland and call it peace 
And I may be poor but I'm thrifty
And I'm so damn through with romance
Gonna take my own advice 
Good enough for Jesus surely 
Good enough for me
