Jack of diamonds 
I've been your old friend 
How could you deceive me this way?

Rebecca 
She said she saw you 
...

Hey Satan
Turn on your high beams 
...

===

I'm gonna move 
To Kansas City 
Honey where I don't belong 
Got friends 
Out in the west of here babe 
Better than I know myself 

Been drinkin
All day 
All of the day before 


Long dark road 
This is the way
Sharp white teeth 
The better to prey


Show me a root in the sky
Teach me to die 

Come here child
This is the way 
... voice in the wild 
Calling her name 

===

I don't call it brave
To feel no fear
Nor feeling to put on false airs

But standing 
The heart's desolation 
Unmoved by the myths of the age

And silence —
She been a root to me babe 

I'm gonna move
To some other City 
Honey where you don't belong 

Come rain 
Come thunder & lightning 
Don't bother me here in my cave 

And darkness —
She been a world to me babe 

In wonder —
Have I known love? Love?

Down dark eyes
This is the way 
Deeper than ten thousand seas
& wide as the sky

Bright black eyes 
Show me the way
Alone in the woodland at night
Calling her name

I been wasted
For over a week now
I ain't gonna drink anymore 

I'll be clean
Chaste & sober
At rest in the tomb of my mind

And silence — 
She been a world to me babe

In wonder —
Have I known love? Love?

Down dark eyes
This is the way
Deeper than ten thousand seas
& wide as the sky

Bright black light
Show me the way 
Howl in the wasteland at night 
Calling her name
