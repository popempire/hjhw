"Love to feel good"
===============

Hang down your head Tom Dooley  
Hang down your head and cry  
You killed little Laura Foster  
You know you're bound to die  

'Cause you love what's good  
You love what's good  
You love to feel good  
Love to feel good  

You like to be an artist  
The finer things in life  
You never seen it coming  

---

No one knows my real name 
I'd tell you if I could 
Maybe if I'd been there 
When he raised the dead

...
Teenage love and cocaine

---

You don't know what love is 
You have forsaken God
You've humbled yourself before mere men
And borne the tyrant's rod

You kissed her and hugged her 
And turned her around 
Then pushed her in the water
Where you know she'll drown 

There ain't one man in twenty 
A young girl can trust 
Soon it's back to ashes
