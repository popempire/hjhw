Oddtime 

All I really need
When I get sadistic

The wires in my head get 
So sick & twisted 

All I been thinking about 
The only thing I couldn't doubt 
The only thing I can't live my life without 
Is real, real good lovin 

The danger in your eyes is
Real real good lovin

The sharpness of your teeth is
Real real good lovin 

Refrain

Child when I go Please don't be sad 
Go out in the world And make it bright

I'm locked up in this cell for 
Crimes of compassion 

The only thing that's real is
All I can't imagine 

Refrain
