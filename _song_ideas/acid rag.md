   riding the crest of the wave  
                                 down

                 some   long

                forgotten 
                         shore

      Talkin to a stranger in my head
      speakin in an old familiar voice
      says Fake it till you one day wake up dead
      poor boy you never really had a choice
      But the wheel keeps turnin for everyone
      and i've been up again all night
      riding the crest of the wave
      down some long forgotten shore

      Finding no reward in earthly fortune
      that favors such a crass unruly few
      lately i've been sittin on a million
      my island lying mostly out of view
      And when the sun drips into the sea
      you can go on and on with me
      riding the crest of the wave
      down some long forgotten shore
      You don't gotta fake it, we can make it

      We oughtta get acquainted, you and i
      we might become good friends here some bright day
      tell me how we never seem to make no money
      girl we've got to give our love a way
      but when the sun drips into the sea
      baby don't you wanna be free
      riding the crest of the wave
      down some long forgotten shore
      We ain't gotta fake it, we can make it

      ===


      I got a lotta strangers in my head

      fake it till you one day wake up dead

      we oughtta get acquainted, you and i
      we might become good friends here by and by


      Lately I've been sittin on a million
      I've been givin all my love a way

      i wish i was a catfish in the sea

      when the sun drips into the sea
      you can go on and on with me
      riding the crest of the wave
      down below the souther shore

      Finding no reward in earthly fortune
      that favors such a crass, unruly few
      i have come to live here as a stranger
      slipping in and mostly out of view
      but the wheel keeps turning for everyone
      and i've been up again all night
      riding the crest of the wave
      down below the southern shore

      Why don't you pretend to be an artist
      you'd be surprised how seldom you're found out

      New acid rag

      The way I kick my head against the wall 
      Makes me think I've sorta lost control 
      Boy you've been a failure what'd you expect?
      You don't love yourself can't come correct 
      Fake it till you make it she said
      Let it kinda get to your head...
      But fakin ain't what shakes my weary blue
      The only thing I wanted here was love

      But fakin ain't what makes the sky so blue
      The only thing I wanna know is you

      You fell in love with an actor, what'd you expect?  
      That ain't the kind that always comes correct  
      But when the sun drips into the sea  
      You can go on and on with me  
      Ride on the crest of the wave  
      Down below those southern shores

      Why don't you pretend to be something you're not?  
      You got a lot of nerve to think you [ain't been] found out  
      Fake it till you make it she said  
      Let it kinda get to your head  
      Rise on the backs of {a|the} poor and oppressed  
      Bewildered herd

      How many {drugs|pills} does it take to feel calm and sane and normal again?  
      How many lies does it take to tell the truth to a man who is under a spell?  
      Don't knock the little girl down she's my friend  
      Don't knock the little girl down she's my friend  
      And the only thing I wanted here was love  
      The only thing I wanted here was love  

      ...
      Kid you got no {trust in|love for} yourself  
      How you gonna {trust|love} someone else?  
      Nobody wants a damn stick in the mud  
      Always hanging round  

      We ought to get acquainted, you and I,
      We might become good friends here by and by
      Fake it till you make it she said
      One day you'll wake up and be dead
      Ride on the crest of the wave 
      Down below those southern shores 

      ...
      Everybody's in on the joke 
      God I wanna choke and die

      You fell in love with another, what'd you expect?  
      You don't love yourself come correct  
      When the sun drips into the sea 
      You can go on and on with me 
      Ride on the crest of the wave down below the southern shores  

      Why don't you pretend to be something you're not?
      You got a lot of nerve to think you'd be found out 
      Fake it till you make it she said
      Let it kinda get to your head
      Rise on backs of a cruel and abject bewildered herd

      How many lies is it gonna take
      To tell the truth I can't relate?
      When am I gonna feel normal again 
      Calm and fit and confident?
      She asks me what I want, said I don't know  
      She asks me what I want, said I don't know  

      We ought to get acquainted, you and I 
      We might become good friends here by and by
      Fake it till you make it she said 
      One day you'll wake up and you're dead
      Riding the crest of the wave down below the southern shores 

      How many lines is it gonna take
      To say the things I can't relate?
      When am I gonna feel normal again
      Calm and fit and confident?
      Don't knock the little girl down, she's my friend  
      Don't knock the little girl down, she's my friend

      ...
      And when the sun drips into the sea
      You can go on and on with me 
      Ride on the crest of the wave down below the southern shores 

      Writing to find out who I am
      Lost in the sea
      Tonight the fog is thick and it looks like a lake
      Maybe a large pond
