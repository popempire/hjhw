ain't she on my mind?
ain't she sorta sweet and strong?
she's my only friend
i'll be with her to the end
...

ain't you on my mind?
ain't i really know your kind?

ain't i love you babe
you don't even know my name

your lips taste like oak
leaves in the rain
soaked drifts of autumn

if i never see you again
hope you think of me as a friend

yeah she knows my name
