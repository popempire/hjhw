I been traveling  across the desert 
They call me  the passing breeze 
Brothers and sisters  I have plenty 
They don't know me   I'm from the open road 

I'm gonna see my mind
Stripped out of my body 
Gonna see all of my—friends 
That I have missed 

Mom and dad  I can't stay here 
I've gotta leave  leave my old home 
Lord I'm going  land of plenty 
Milk and honey   I'll wear my brand new clothes 

I'm gonna see my mind 
Stripped out of my body 
Gonna see all of my friends that I have missed 

{they wanna strip my mind 
Warm and dark and lovely
Gonna sit all of my—children
round the table}

Come on babe  what's the matter with you?
Why don't you love me  like you used to do 
You know my hair  is still curly 
And my eyes  are still blue 

{friends I've missed and girls I've kissed}

I'm gonna seat all of my children round the table 
I'm gonna see all of my friends that I have missed 

I'm gonna go someplace 
Warm and dark and lovely 
I'm gonna see all of my friends that I have missed 

I'm gonna strip my mind 
Of flesh and bone and body
I'm gonna seat all of my children round the table
