eisenhower's highways is a long long crooked line  
i-75's a groove for my wicked mind

i try to walk on the straight road, all hustle no luck  
i lost my only friend was a long gone pickup truck

i can't tell my future, i can't tell my past  
everything i ever known sure never seem to last

when i left the backroads the moon was shining bright  
when i drove half my home was almost broad daylight
