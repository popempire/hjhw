Make Your Motor Hum
-------------------

*7/30/25*

    Your love is the sunlight on a peaceful afternoon
    Birdsong in the air in the month of June
    The deepest shadows of doubt
        Despair to see your spark flame out
    And spread sweet light through each every corner
        Of the long lonely land of my heart

    Your love is the only thing that keeps me warm at night
    Sun lights up the day but don't treat me right
    I was blind, deaf, & dumb
        Till I felt your motor hum
    And spread sweet love like lightning through the air
        Of the sky of the world without end

    And it's sweet love lies stretched out on the floor
        Hey alright, hey alright, hey alright!

    My cold heart beats like a drum
        Good God, to feel your motor hum

    Your love is the darkness that connects me to the sky
    The stars wheel up above and I wonder why
    The deepest haunts of the sea
        have seen/know no fish that's stranger than me
    Until bright love flamed out upon the face
        Of the cold, far-flung world without end

    
    My true self has no arms nor legs nor  head of hair
    The real me can't be found just anywhere
    The heart, the guts, and the spleen
        Of a magical fucking machine
    Yes, it's sweet love that makes your motor hum
        Hey alright, hey alright, hey alright
