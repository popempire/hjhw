have you seen my         baby?
                 walkin
 side
             of the road
if you
     seen my baby
                  (lord)
she ain't got no place
               to go
    Who's gonna shoe her little feet
    who's gonna glove her hands
    who's gonna kiss her red
                            red lips
who's gonna be her man?
   
   Psyche walk
                   beside me
dark end
             of the road
can't find
        no hearts
  to bind no place
                like home
    Brightness of midnight
    is ever around her
    loneliness and death-rattle
    stillness go beside her
who's gonna be her man
