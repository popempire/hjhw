My baby's all summer then she's all winter 
She don't celebrate the Fall
She don't tolerate no evil to be found 
She's the sweetest thing She's my girl 

My baby's cool silver and stately black 
She can operate my gun
She don't contemplate no Evil against her man
She's the sweetest thing she's my girl 

I don't dream sweet dreams about her
I can't sleep sweet sleep without her
I can't tease apart the day
She's the sweetest thing So pretty as she lies
Nothing beautiful is true 

I can go anywhere 
I can do anything 
I can be anything 
I can be anyone
