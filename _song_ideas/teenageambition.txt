All I wanna keep is a soul that's clean
a girl who'll share my name and a match with a flame
the flood is in the blackout,
the fire's in the blackout too

All I really need is a bit of luck
with a loaded magazine and a bright green machine
they can send me off to heaven
when they put me on a tv show

All I wanna do is something big
when the masterpiece don't fade, now do we make the grade?
the picture's in the blackout,
the fading's in the blackout too

All I wanna be is a superstar
starving artist downtown in a cowboy flat
the suckers couldn't kill him
so they put him on a tv show

Forget about your sorrow
forget about your happy
forget about the feeling of the inside of your skull
forget about your angry
forget about your lonely
gotta get back that velvet feeling

All I really want is some peace of mind
I can't see what I do, so I do it blind
the virtue's in the black out,
the beauty's in the black out too

All I really need is a pulse, don't you know
some sunshine and some rain, that's how the garden grow
nothing's gonna kill me,
they put me on a tv show
