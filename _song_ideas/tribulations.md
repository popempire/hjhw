  Trials troubles tribulations  
     such as  
                 never  
been before   when  
  The sun don't shine  
                   his  
 light & the moon  
all die of fright  
            fire come down  
    from heaven the blood  
  shall fill the sea  

  I've been chosen & anointed  
      I am  
               come  
at the dawn of  time  
   so like lightning  
                   strike  
the east flash!  
                        far out into the west  
    I am death  
       there is no fullness  
  without me  

  the mark  
       must be upon  
           your forehead  
these worldly goods  you  
                   then  
 can buy  
    Depart from   me       I  
 never knew you  
i hear my blessed savior  
                      cry no  
second sight no soft wind  
                         blows  
 no hope for rest

      « I am Death
there is no fullness without me »
