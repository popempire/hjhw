All My Tears
------------
Recorded by Emmylou Harris

    Am
    When I go don't cry for me
    C     G                  Am
    In my Fatherâ€™s arms I'll be

    The wounds this world left on my soul
         C      G                  Am
    Will all be healed and I'll be whole


    Sun and moon will be replaced
    C        G              Am
    With the light of Jesus face

    And I will not be ashamed
    C      G               Am
    For my Savior knows my name

             C                     Am
    It don't matter where you bury me
    C       G                Am
    I'll be home and I'll be free
             C              Am
    It don't matter where I lay
    C      G               Am
    All my tears be washed away


    Gold and silver blind the eye
    C     G          Am
    Temporary riches lie

    Come and eat from heaven's store
    C                  G         Am
    Come and drink and thirst no more


    So weep not for me my friend
    C       G               Am
    When my time below does end

    For my life belongs to him
    C        G              Am
    Who will raise the dead again
