Roscoe Holcomb's "Graveyard Blues" is a perfect specimen of Appalachian blues
poetry. It opens with "I got up this morning / with the blues  all around my bed"
— this phrase, or a close variant, is the opening of thousands of blues. 
It functions somewhat like the phrase "Once upon a time in a land far away".

As the narrative unfolds, Roscoe sings of an encounter with a gravedigger in a 
graveyard. The singer pleads with this gravedigger to return a deceased loved one.
This resonates with the lyrics of other country blues that feature negotiation
with a custodian of the dead ("I asked that undertaker / 'Undertaker, please drive
slow'" as in "Can the Circle Be Unbroken"). In some songs, the negotiation is 
with Death personified, or with some supernatural custodian of the dead (Charon, 
Hades, the Devil, St. Peter, et al.). The choice of a naturalistic, human 
interlocutor in this role in Holcomb's version is not accidental. It emphasizes
the gritty reality of the emotions of pain and loss which are lingered on in
the song.

One of the great poetic powers of blues lyricism is to linger on a certain 
*feeling* for an extended, indefinite period — really milking it for all its worth,
if you feel like it, much longer than strictly necessary to convey the words.
And then, very suddenly, at the end of a phrase to shift the entire context or
meaning of that feeling.

Just as Holcomb's "Graveyard Blues" reaches its emotional climax, "Then I wrung
my hands / Says I wanted to scream" — and we'll definitely take a moment to 
dwell on this feeling — the opening line of the song is repeated, but then the
entire context of the song is shifted: "I got up this morning, and found it was
only a dream".

Some dreams seem to be chaotic and random, kind of like mental white noise. 
Some dreams seem to carry symbolism and yet their meanings are quite obscure.
Some dreams have quite a plain meaning, if you will look them square in the eyes.
They show us our own feelings, the fundamental truths of our own lives. The love
of a partner, family member, or dear friend is one of these truths, and as an
*emotion*, loving someone is very much like recognizing that your own thriving
is dependent on their life and thriving.

Revealing some emotionally charged sequence of events to be a dream is of course
a classic narrative trick for releasing tension and inducing surprise at the 
same time. By executing this shift quickly, "Graveyard Blues" is structured 
much like some jokes, with a slow build leading up to a quick punchline, then out.
Given the content of the song, it doesn't hit so much like a joke because humor
is not the dominant flavor here, yet there is indeed a recognizable *playfulness*.
Because the song has lingered so long on the *pain of loss*, but then suddenly
removed all the sting of this loss by revealing it to be a dream, we are left
reflecting on the meaning of this pain from at a remove. It is in fact a very
sweet and melancholy affirmation of a singer's love, of a singer's needing 
another for their inmost thriving.

"Lazarus" is a name that comes to us through the Hellenization of the Hebrew
name "Eleazar". It has been in use among Jewish commnunities for millennia.
