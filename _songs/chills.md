    you bring me up to get me down
    well i'm sick and tired of this one street town
    i tried to be nice, i played the fool
    now nothing's gonna make me lose some cool
    you don't need the friends when you got the drugs
    they're just piggies in the blanket in the bed like bugs
    now i lock that door and stay at home
    and disconnect that telephone, because
    the cold-hearted chills won't let me alone

    ooh ooh ooh ooh
    ooh ooh ooh ooh
    ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
    ooh ooh ooh ooh

    i don't believe in no cynic's creed
    i just believe in death and greed
    i don't love the children, don't love the bums
    don't love justice and it never comes
    now if you want emotion got to pay the price
    and no i don't love money but it sure is nice
    i'm disconnecting that telephone
    singing and dancing to the gramophone, because
    the black-hearted blues won't let me alone

    ooh ooh ooh ooh
    ooh ooh ooh ooh
    ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
    ooh ooh ooh ooh

    i feel good, and i feel fine
    and i ain't gonna make your troubles mine
    i don't burn and rave, i don't weep and moan
    got the cold-hearted chills to keep me alone


this song was written during my freshman year at the university of cincinnati, in 2008. that year was easily the most antisocial of my life. living in the dormitories brought out a vivacious misanthropic streak in me. the opening line suggests shades of marc bolan's "hang ups" from dandy in the underworld. the "one street town" may be construed to refer to the uc campus, of which a surprisingly large proportion is called "main street", or more specifically the first floor of turner hall -- or more generally the social world in which i found myself, which while perhaps metropolitan enough to support more than one horse, it seemed, nevertheless had not the wealth to expand into more than one street.

a common experience of american youth is the seeming necessity to affect friendship with certain others, whom one despises, solely in order to partake in the drugs that this person or these people are able to procure.

the cincinnati area and the area around the university in particular, clifton and its neighboring communities, had begun to experience an extended resurgence of bedbug infestations around the time i started college. pigs-in-blankets and bedbugs seemed somehow apt images to depict the lascivious squalor that i saw around me.

disconnecting the telephone, like rocking out to the gramophone, is a distinctly old-fashioned kind of thing to do. it seems to me that the misanthropic spirit has a particular affinity to the nostalgic spirit. at least, when the modern man begins to bemoan the nature and quality of human relations and the impossiblity of getting any real time to oneself, he is likely to paint the "old days" in rosy hues, hearkening back to a time when we didn't carry around our telephones and music libraries with us everywhere.

"if you want emotion got to pay the price" -- these are words of oscar wilde.
