Judges 3:12-30

    Everybody's talking 'bout going down 
    To see the show 
    I can't even wrap my head around it 
    Look at them go 

    Bodies made up of empty spaces 
    That never touch 
    Circumscribed by a viscous oozing 
    Of inarticulate mass 

    People always told me
    Life's full of surprises 
    It finds a way
    Round and round again

    The king's daughter in a violin string
    Evening gown
    Drives the knife and the fat enfolds it
    God smiling down 

    People always told me
    Life's full of surprises 
    It finds a way
    Round and round again
