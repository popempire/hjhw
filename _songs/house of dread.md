    back in eastern tennessee
    there's a weeping willow tree
    in an alley down below the summer sun
    where my friends and i would play
    spending many a pretty day
    and many nights below the stars we'd adjourn

    now the wind blows cold
    through the crack in the window
    my blankets are pulled up around my head
    a country soul in a dirty city
    left but to dream of the home i fled

    buck creek's long but not too wide
    where the crawdads swim and hide
    and the moss covered rocks creep(?) crackling o'er my feet
    the smell of bluegill in the air
    along the trickling thoroughfare
    and the scent of honeysuckle vine is sweet

    (refrain)

    i left my old clinch mountain home
    though my daddy said don't go
    how i wish that i'd listened to him then
    i lost my children and my wife
    beer and whiskey wrecked my life
    and i'm never gonna see my home again

    (refrain)
    on a street called doom
    in the house of dread
