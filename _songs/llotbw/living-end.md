    I get ahead on my motorbike
    I get ahead on my motorbike
    I feel so quick in my leather boots
    I feel so quick in my leather boots
    My mood is black when my jacket's on
    My mood is black when my jacket's on

    And I'm in love with myself
    And I'm in love with myself
    There's nothing else but me
    There's nothing else but me
    And the empty road
    And the cool, cool breeze
    Makes me feel so good
    Just like I knew it would
    Like I knew it would

    I get so wild on my motorbike
    I get so wild on my motorbike
    I'm breaking loose on this moonlit night
    I'm breaking loose on this moonlit night
    I cut the road like a sharpened knife
    I cut the road like a sharpened knife

    And I'm in love with myself
    And I'm in love with myself
    There's nothing else but me
    There's nothing else but me
    And the empty road
    And the cool, cool breeze
    Makes me feel so good
    Just like I knew it would
    Like I knew it would

    I'm moving so fast, you know it gets so fast
    I'm moving so fast that I can't control the wheels
    I'm moving too fast, you know it gets so fast
    I'm going for a tree, it's coming for me
    My head is dripping into my leather boots

The harmonic progression of I-IV-V-I is one of the most fundamental in the
American Popular style. It is a common motif in the songs of The Jesus and Mary Chain.
This basic structure allows for almost endless variation.

One of the stylistic principles of the Blues, from a theoretical perspective,
is that the *changes*, i.e. the harmonic structure, can be extended or condensed
arbitrarily in time. The familiar 12-bar blues, which is often held up when people
ask what is the basic underlying harmonic structure of the blues, is by no means
definitive — it is merely one popular manifestation of a more fundamental structure
that is not tied to any particular number of measures or beats.

One of the most characteristic lyrical motifs of the blues is what some describe
as the reversal of the "typical" sequence of verse and refrain — in the blues,
the refrain comes before the verse, rather than the other way around. It is the 
repetition of a line, followed by a single line that develops the sense of the 
preceding repeated lines.

The Jesus and Mary Chain (the brothers Jim and William Reid) draw on both of these
veins of the blues to create something that is formally beautiful in a minimalist
and modern way with their song "The Living End", the second track from their
groundbreaking debut album *Psychocandy* from 1985. At the same time, they 
created something which, lyrically, is both an expression of nihilistic adolescent rebellion
and a compact moral tale. In the way that is so characteristic of their early 
style, they then obscure the formal elegance and craft of their work in behind
a heavy curtain of noise and reverb. They rush through the song as if they were
about to lose control of their guitars and drive full speed into a tree.
