  > Preacher have you told them  
  > That hell is real
  > The big one's coming, sure as hell
  > And no one's at the wheel

These lines are annotated in the manuscript as a "literal description of driving
down I-75 on acid".

  > A friend of mine sold acid (LSD) one summer when he was in college to make
  a bit of extra money. He would buy a few sheets and cut the sheets into strips.
  One day he decided to transport a few strips surreptitiously by placing them
  in his shoe. LSD is a Schedule I drug after all, and getting caught with intent
  to sell was a much bigger deal than, say, getting caught with Marijuana (which
  was in fact still a bit of a big deal back then, unlike today). He placed the
  strips in tinfoil, but only enfolded them like a pocketbook, rather than 
  wrapping them completely. Some of the strips moved about in his shoe, and in
  that moist environment the acid began to dissolve and pass through his socks,
  through his epidermis, and into his bloodstream.

  > He realized he was tripping as he was driving down Interstate 75. He read the
  billboard that says "Hell Is Real" and saw an enormous gyrating spiral of 
  color consume the road in front of him.

They are also a reference to:

  + Satan Is Real - Louvin Brothers

satan is a *narrative imperative*.
although he doesn't strictly make sense in the context of a developed high
theology monotheism, the Christian intellectualists have been unable to 
exorcise him from the popular imagination.

  + The Devil Was a Preacher - Pop Empire

from the album *The Devil's Party*, which was thematically inspired by Milton's
*Paradise Lost*. The name comes from a quote by William Blake, who said of 
Milton, "he was a true poet, and of the devil's party without knowing it".

*Paradise Lost* was meant to be just the opening act for *Paradise Regained*,
just as *Inferno* was just the first part in Dante's Divine Comedy Trilogy.
Yet why have these descriptions of the darkest parts of our imagination
turned out to be so much more interesting than the supposed climaxes of the 
story?
