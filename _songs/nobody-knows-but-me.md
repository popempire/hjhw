    C                      A7
    Nobody knows about the jailhouse blues
    D7               G7      C
    till you get within four walls

        C                         A7
    The old jailer man turns that big black key
    D7                      G7
    that's when your spirit falls

        C             C7
    You drag yourself up to the bars
        F                  F#dim
    and while you gaze out at the stars
    D7                  G7
    This is what you'll say...

    C                        A7
    Why did I stray from the righteous path?
    D7     G7        C
    nobody knows but me

    C                        A7
    There on the outside you all can laugh
        D7                     G7
    but I don't need your sympathy

        C                       C7
    For after I've paid for the liquor I sold
        F                         F#dim
    I'll leave this place worth my weight in gold

      C                        A7
    So why did I stray from the righteous path?
    D7     G7        C
    nobody knows but me

    [Instrumental]

    When you realize that you're all alone
      seated in a two-by-four
    That little cell is just a taste of hell
      if you ain't been there before
    Well you're locked up tight but they treat you fair
      You get everything that you need in there
    That's just why you'll say...

    Why did I stray from the righteous path?
      nobody knows but me
    There on the outside you all can laugh
      I don't need your sympathy
    For after I've paid for the liquor I sold
      I'll leave this place worth my weight in gold
      C                        A7
    So why did I stray from the righteous path--
    D7     G7        C   A7
    nobody knows but me  !

    D7     G7        C
    Nobody knows but me
