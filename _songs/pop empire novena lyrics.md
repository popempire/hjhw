THE WAY
-------

    In your time of the heart's desolation—  
    the imperial peace of despair—  
    I don't call it brave to feel no fear  
    nor, feeling, to put on false airs:  
    you're brave, my dear, to fight a whole war inside you  
    in silence, unmoved by the myths of the age.

    Bright, dark eyes, show me the way—  
    yours was made to love, mine made to pray.

    If your mind could have its own way with the world  
    you'd set all the prisoners free;  
    and love—sweet love—would not need a champion;  
    nor lover a lie to believe:  
    the silent greenbriar rose in your heart—  
    lonely—grows into song.

*(refrain x2)*

BLACK WINE
----------

    Your voice was the first thing that I loved—  
    it called me from a distant place.  
    I've walked the mansion of your mind—  
    are you also just a visitor here?  

    Hey, hey, black wine  
    hey, hey, black wine!  

    I'm free to serve no other master.  
    No words disclose your heart's design.  
    There is no one I—no window to the world  
    but blue eternal skies of wonder.

*(refrain x2)*

SISTER CHAOS
------------

    Long before the world began  
    she had me in the palm of her hand—  
    she shook my wrist like the will-o-the-wisp  
    and darkness hovers over the deep.

    Sister Chaos—  
    that's what she does that's what she do—  
    that's my old friend, I know her by her ways.

    I can't afford to drive in my car—  
    how am I gonna get where you are?  
    Shrouds of fathomless nothingness   
    surround me and I'm bound to your star.

*(refrain)*

    I feel so low to the ground  
    I could fall in a puddle and drown.  
    The moon's down there with her long dark hair,  
    black habit, and her red shoes on.

    Here she come, my shadow, Sister Chaos—  
    bye bye baby, by and by—  
    that's my old friend, I know her by her ways—  
    my old friend, I know her by her ways.

BAD NEWS BOOGIE
---------------

    I got friends—so-called friends—  
    they're so sweet and suicidal:  
    sorta free, sorta brave,  
    so afraid and conflicted.

    I get so hung on people and I want them to be close  
    but I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

    Yeah yeah yeah!

    You know I like you, and I don't care—  
    I'll cut myself to be like you.  
    I wanna love—it hurts to love—  
    I wanna hurt to feel something.

    I'm sick, broke, lonely, wasted, and if I don't leave this place,  
    god, I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

    Yeah yeah yeah!

    I've hit the wall—I'm freaking out—  
    lost control, nothing's helping.  
    Hold me now—hold me now—  
    I'm going down in a spiral.

    Everything is broken and I know it can't be fixed—  
    god I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

    Yeah yeah yeah!

REAL GOOD LOVE
--------------

    It's all I really need when I get sadistic,  
    when wires in my head get so sick and twisted:  
    all I been thinking about,  
    the only thing I couldn't doubt,  
    all that I couldn't live my life without  
    is real, real good loving.

    The danger in your eyes is real, real good loving.  
    The sharpness of your teeth is real, real good loving.  
    All I been thinking about,  
    the only thing I couldn't doubt,  
    all that I couldn't live my life without  
    is real, real good loving.

    Child, when I go now don't you cry—  
    you gotta get up in the world and make it bright.

    I'm locked up in this self for crimes of compassion,  
    and all I really want is what I can't imagine.  
    All I been thinking about,  
    the only thing I couldn't doubt,  
    all that I couldn't live my life without  
    is real, real good loving.

    Child, when I go now don't you cry—  
    you gotta get up in the world and make it bright.

    Baby, if I go now don't you cry—  
    you're gonna walk in daisy chains of solar light.

NIGHTWALKING
------------

    I go out walking after midnight,  
    coming down the sky to set you free—  
    mama, don't you hear me crying?  
    You only see the ones in the light.

    In the high sodium-vapor-yellow  
    lonesome air, the silent twilight's fall  
    silhouettes a figure:  
    you only see the ones in the light,  
    others drift away in the shadow.

    She goes out somewhere in the darkness—  
    in her eyes, the phosphorescent gleam:  
    the one I love is ghostly.  
    You only see the ones in the light,  
    others drift away in the shadow.

    You only see the ones in the light,  
    others drift away in the shadows.

FOOL ALL OVER
-------------

    Lilies of white, roses of red,  
    myrtle of black and pale amaranth—  
    o my god, what have I done?  
    Paranoia's at the door.

    The dress is old, the body is new—  
    sister's eyes of empyrean blue:   
    o my god, where have you been?  
    Love don't live here anymore.

    I've gone and spent my life  
    waiting, hanging out—  
    hanging out—hanging out—  
    hanging round.

    We two are one and the devil is three—  
    blood from the bark of a dogwood tree:  
    o my god, how could you forsake me?  
    I wanna start all over again.

    When I've gone and spent my life  
    waiting, hanging out—  
    hanging out—hanging out—  
    hanging round.

    I've been a fool.  
    I've been a fool—  
    I've been a fool all over you.  
    I'm over you.

    I've gone and spent my life  
    waiting, hanging out—  
    hanging out—hanging out—  
    hanging round.

FOR MAGGIE
----------

    I am a child of earth and starry sky.  
    I was born—born to die.  
    Lay me in the water, lay me to drown—  
    wake me up from the lake of memory.  

    I'll go down—down to hell and meet 'em.  
    I'll go down and nevermore go there.  
    It was late in the night—they were both sleeping—  
    little Maggie appeared, standing by the bed.  

    Saying, "How do you like your snow white pillow?  
    And how do you like your soft white sheet?  
    How do you like that sweet thing lying in your arms—  
    lyin' in your arms—arms asleep?"  

    Well, my friend, I believe you're dying.  
    I tried to take you with me, tried to bring you back.  
    It was all in your mind—all in your mind.  

    I am a child of earth and starry sky.  
    I was born—born to die.  
    Lay me in the water—lay me to drown—  
    wake me up—lake of memory.  

RIDING THE CREST
----------------

    Riding on that crest of silver-starlight-  
    dazzled dim, dark water by the shore  
    where the soul's own memory roams,  
    longing fills my heart with pain—  
    sweet white Moon, and has my love been all in vain?

    I been talking with a stranger in my head.  
    "Fake it till you make it," what he said.  
    "Do right like the millionaire do:  
    sell and make a million too.  
    Love yourself, just pretend you're someone else."

    The wolf said to the lamb, "Now don't you fear,  
    your father up in heaven brought you here.  
    When the sun drips into the sea,  
    you can come and go with me,  
    preaching the backslide junkies on back to their wandering soul."

    Come all you strange, unearthly creatures—  
    come all you children of the night\!  
    Satan, turn your high beams on,  
    play my baby's song once more—  
    riding the crest of the wave down some long-forgotten shore.
