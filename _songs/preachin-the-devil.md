  > Preacher have you told them  
  > That hell is real
  > The big one's coming, sure as hell
  > And no one's at the wheel

These lines are annotated in the manuscript as a "literal description of driving
down I-75 on acid".

They are also a reference to:

  + Satan Is Real - Louvin Brothers

satan is a *narrative imperative*
although he doesn't strictly make sense in the context of a developed high
theology monotheism

  + The Devil Was a Preacher - Pop Empire

from the album *The Devil's Party*, which was thematically inspired by Milton's
*Paradise Lost*. The name comes from a quote by William Blake, who said of 
Milton, "he was a true poet, and of the devil's party without knowing it".

*Paradise Lost* was meant to be just the opening act for *Paradise Regained*,
just as *Inferno* was just the first part in Dante's Divine Comedy Trilogy.
Yet why have these descriptions of the darkest parts of our imagination
turned out to be so much more interesting than the supposed climaxes of the 
story?
