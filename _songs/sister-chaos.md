    SISTER CHAOS

    Cm
    Long before the world began
        Eb
    she had me in the palm of her hand--
        Cm                      Bb
    she shook my wrist like the will-o-the-wisp
        Eb                       F
    and darkness hovers over the deep.

    Sister Chaos--
                    Bb                   Cm
    that's what she does that's what she do--
              Bb                   Eb        Cm
    that's my old friend, I know her by her ways.

      Cm          
    I can't afford to drive in my car--
    Cm                           Bb
    how am I gonna get where you are?
    Cm                    Bb
    Shrouds of fathomless nothingness
      Eb                             Cm
    surround me and I'm bound to your star.

    Sister Chaos--
    that's what she does that's what she do--
    that's my old friend, I know her by her ways.

    I feel so low to the ground
    I could fall in a puddle and drown.
        Cm                         Bb
    The moon's down there with her long dark hair,
          Eb                      Cm
    black habit and her red shoes on.

    Cm
    Here she come, my shadow, Sister Chaos--
            Bb           Cm
    bye-bye baby, by and by--
              Bb                     Eb      Cm
    that's my old friend, I know her by her ways--
      Bb                   Eb       Cm
    my old friend, I know her by her ways.
      Bb                     Eb   F  F7
    my old friend, I know her by....
          
      her ways.
