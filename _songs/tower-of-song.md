Tower of Song
-------------
by Leonard Cohen  
from *I'm Your Man* (1988)

    E
    Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey

    I ache in the places where I used to play
            A                                 E
    And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
             B                    A                   E
    I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song

    I said to Hank Williams, how lonely does it get?
    Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
    But I hear him coughing all night long
    Oh, a hundred floors above me in the Tower of Song

    I was born like this, I had no choice
    I was born with the gift of a golden voice
    And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
    They tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song

    So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
    I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
    I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
    Ah, they don't let a woman kill you, not in the Tower of Song

    Now, you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
    The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
    And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
    You see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song

    I see you standing on the other side
    I don't know how the river got so wide
    I loved you baby, way back when
    And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
    But I feel so close to everything that we lost
    We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again

    Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
    They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
    But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
    I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song

    Yeah, my friends are gone and my hair is gray
    I ache in the places where I used to play
    And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
    I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song
