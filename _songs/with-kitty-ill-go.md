    WITH KITTY I'LL GO

    It's with Kitty I'll go for a ramble
    All over the mountains wild
    Where the blackbirds nest in the brambles
    In the home where the eagle chides
    Or in some lonely valley
    Where the birds in the evening nest
    And mine with their prayers would mingle
    For the sun to hurry west

    Oh, my darling wee lark of the heather
    Her voice is so sweet to me
    As the stars all singing together
    Where the mountains sweep down to the sea
    And all of Erin's bright treasures
    All her beautiful locks and rills
    Cannot equal one smile from my Caitlin
    My queen of the heathery hills

    Oh, I'll buy the roughest of raiment
    To last out the life of man
    My whiskers unkempt and unshaven
    Till the reach is a mile in span
    Like the fleece of the grey mountain wether
    They'll tumble and dangle around
    If I don't get a wife in the heather
    I'll try in the low, low ground


    From the singing of Jean Ritchie
