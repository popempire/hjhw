Young Henry
===========

*Roud 47*

This song has also been known as “Henry Lee” (as by Dick Justice) 
and earlier as “Young Hunting” (Child No. 68).

Bronson pp. 174-178

  > The tune used in this version is a new invention which came to me on my drive back from Albuquerque NM to Cincinnati OH (January 2019, I think) although it was not until some while later that I connected it to the text.
  > 
  > I tried the tunes used on this album for “Tom Dula” and “Young Henry” swapped.

Bronson alludes to a relationship between this ballad and *Lady Isabel* (Child No. 4).
