Young Henry
===========

*Roud 47*

This song has also been known as “Henry Lee” (as by Dick Justice) 
and earlier as “Young Hunting” (Child No. 68).

Bronson pp. 174-178

  > The tune used in this version is a new invention which came to me on my drive back from Albuquerque NM to Cincinnati OH (January 2019, I think) although it was not until some while later that I connected it to the text.
  > 
  > I tried the tunes used on this album for “Tom Dula” and “Young Henry” swapped.

Bronson alludes to a relationship between this ballad and *Lady Isabel* (Child No. 4).

The story centers on a young noblewoman — in some versions her name is Lady Maisry.
As the scene opens, she has just become aware that her former lover is arriving
upon her land. He is known by various aliases in different versions:
young Hunting, young Riedan, Earl Richard, Sir William, lovin' Henry.

From very early on, there seems to be a degree of uncertainty in the texts as to 
whether "hunting" is a proper name or just a descriptor of the ill-fated ex-lover.
I hypothesize therefore that Hunting was indeed the man's original name. It would
be natural enough for a listener to hear the ballad and interpret the somewhat
unusual name as a description of someone who was literally hunting, or who was
known to enjoy hunting. It would be less likely that a young man who was said to
be hunting, because he was literally hunting, would be assumed to be *named*
Hunting.

With seductive intention, we presume, she trie to convince him to stay with
her overnight — or at least to stay for a few drinks. He does not agree to stay
the night with her, and almost invariably he insults her by declaring his 
preference for an unnamed woman elsewhere, but he does agree to hang out and 
have a few drinks with her. Once he's got his guard fully down, she kills him
with a knife.

At this point we are introduced to the next most important character in this
story — not indeed the bird (called a parrot or parriot in many versions), but
another young woman, who is either the companion or maidservant of Lady Maisry.
In one version, her name is Katharine. She is shocked by the murder, but she
is compelled by Maisry to become her accomplice. If Katharine was her social 
equal and companion, Maisry convinces her that they're in this together — 
accusations will stick equally to both of them. Or if Katharine was Maisry's
servant, it would have been a simple matter to demand that she help with 
covering up the murder.

In some versions, this character has been replaced by an unspecified group of 
servants both male and female, and in others she has been replaced by a group
of local women.

In any case, Katharine or the persons that take her place are instrumental in
helping the murderess dispose of the body. They dress him as if he had been out
riding; they take him out to a particularly deep spot in the pool beneath a 
waterfall, at a place called Clyde's Water; they weight his body down so that he
sinks to the bottom.

Incidentally, the king and his retinue come riding by very shortly after the
murder. They stop at the manor of our anti-heroine and ask after Hunting. They 
had known that he was passing by this way, and in fact a member of the household
confirmed that he had been with the two young women. Hunting was known to the 
king, who wished to invite the young man to join his ride. When the young
women were asked about his whereabouts, they said they hadn't seen him since at
least the day before. But they give slightly different accounts. Maisry suggests
that he might have gone riding up toward's Clyde's Water, and she sure hopes
he didn't fall in and drown.

At the suggestion of a meddlesome bird, the king sends divers to search the pool
for Hunting. The same bird has already appeared also to Maisry. At first she 
tries to bargain with it in much the same manner as she attempted to convince
Hunting to stay with her. But the bird is not to be fooled, and it gives her a 
couple specific pieces of advice. She is to pay her companion or maidservant
back in some way. And she is taunted to be careful not to touch the body of her
victim, because blood would reveal her to be the murderer. This latter is an
expression of a once common belief, sometimes admitted as evidence in criminal trials,
that if a murderer touched the corpse of their victim, it would cause blood to
spill from the body.

The divers are initially unsuccessful in finding any remains of Hunting.
However, the bird explains that they shouldn't bother trying to dive during the
day. Rather, they should dive at night, in the location marked by candle-light.
There are a couple ways this may have originally been understood. A footnote
in Child's 1860 edition of the *Ballads* expressed quite confidently that this
is a reference to the "corpse lights", which are described as a folk belief in
a sort of spiritual presence, visible only at night, lingering around the
resting place of the deceased — but which were probably in fact the result of
some phosphorescent swamp gas.

On the other hand, this may be a reference to a type of divination which also
was used in certain archaic criminal proceedings, where a blessed candle was 
set to float in a body of water where a body was being searched for — the location
of the candle would indicate the location of the body.

After heeding the bird's advice once more, the body is found, and the king 
immediately orders the murdereresses to be burned. In some versions, Maisry
tries to pass all the blame on to her reluctant accomplice. The king's men first
try to burn Katharine, the servant or friend, but she is not consumed by the
flames, suffering perhaps only minor injuries such as singed hair. Then they 
realize that the noblewoman Lady Maisry has been the murderer all along, they
cast her into the fire, and she burns. The end.

The most important drama in this story is between the two women, rather than
between the first woman and her ex-lover, which just sets up the action.
And what can we say about the talking bird?
