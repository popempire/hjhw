<p><u>Your Times Are Gonna Get You</u><br />
Henry Wilson 2008</p>

<p>
The lines of Eisenhower's highways,<br />
the railroads and the skyways<br />
gonna sink in the face of this old, old world.<br />
Just like ten thousand years ago,<br />
it's ten thousand more to go,<br />
braking in the sun till the sun breaks down.<br />
The fast lane's a kick,<br />
it's a modern rabbit trick,<br />
but when the hare in your hat is a slowly going gray<br />
you know that age is a killer,<br />
like every other age before.<br />
I saw Achilles race the turtle&mdash;he was nipping at his heels;<br />
you can chase a short life<br />
for eternal fame in death,<br />
and in the end you'll need noone but noone else to blame<br />
'cause you know
</p>

<p>
You know your times are gonna get you<br />
you can embrace it or wrestle in vain<br />
and as for me, i'll take the long road<br />
and go where i'm sent by this new century
</p>

<p>Science proved the face<br />
of the earth is curved&mdash;<br />
yeah, well, with science you can prove the whole universe is curved.<br />
My tall hat, my tattooed gown,<br />
my ancestors in the ground&mdash;<br />
you know that none stay on forever, but some come back around,<br />
'cause you know

<p>
your times are gonna get you<br />
you can embrace it or wrestle in vain<br />
and as for me, i'll take the straight road<br />
and bend like i'm bent by this new century
</p>

<p>Hey! Walt Disney,<br />
won't you give me your hand?<br />
I want to dance till the sun shakes out all over this land,<br />
because noone lives forever<br />
and we like it that way.<br />
We go on dancing and kicking while the clock is a tick in the brain</p>

<p>
your times are gonna get you<br />
you can embrace it or wrestle in vain<br />
and as for me, i'll take the long road<br />
and go where i'm sent by this new century
