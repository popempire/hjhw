when i am asked, what is rock n roll?, and if i were to answer in paragraphic
short response, i would be sure to invoke Chuck berry and Elvis, from one or
the other of these beacons thrusting backwards or forwards in history or indeed
laterally, recounting stories of Eddie cochran or other early martyrs. But this
should not be construed to mean that these are definitive landmarks. I wish to
signify a living strain -- not that other artists who form part of this organism
necessarily play the same music, but they dig Chuck berry and Elvis records for
sure, and then other kids come along and listen to that and dig the same thing,
whether they know about Chuck berry or not.

music these days is an organism of ideas. it is a very exciting time for music.
of course, it has been so for a good while, some centuries at least.
	One thing; set aside for a moment all talk about the industry and the
market and records and the internet, Music in our culture stands as an incredibly
robust institution. In fact things are going remarkably well for music these
days. And consider that this could have been otherwise -- mankind might have come
to prefer a more referential auditory stimulation to the exclusion of fire
works and music and such things. On the other hand, I don't think I could fully
imagine a people such as this.
