I've known some to hold the line at veganism in the assurance that it is a stance which can offend no one -- if it be wrong, it could not be wrong in the Wrong way -- how can someone's conscientious abstention trouble or interfere with another? Here as in so many places people display such provincialism of their times -- how can they not see that in another time others may be scandalized by the consumption of plants and bacteria and archaea and fungi and be shocked even at the notion that man -- "homo sapiens" -- should carry on and seek after a biological existence at all. Is it so ridiculous? of course it is now, for no living human being could forego ingestion of living or formerly living organic matter. Someone something somewhere has got to die -- sometimes it's us or them, you or me. But couldn't we build a both/and future? Couldn't we learn to photosynthesize like the trees and flowers just as we learned to fly like the birds and insects? and if we could, would it not perhaps be Morally Incumbent upon us to refrain from all killing -- should it perhaps be unlawful even to kill any plant or insect or microorganism? after all, they don't try to kill you. Yet the heathen Vegan would sow vast fields of grain and bean and vegetable for cyclical slaughter -- give Being to a germ and this world looks more horrible than imagination.
