at the end of this month i will have been six months at bloc coffee company. to mark the occasion, i have requested to have a meeting with rhett to talk about the future, life, the meaning of it all. here are a few scattered formulations in consideration of this conversation-to-be.

a fellow gets to be such an age, twenty five, and finds that he had better figure out some shit he had never figured out before. no longer is it the day to live in impermanence and chaos. a man comes to desire and to demand a routine, a measure of respect. it is not the case that bloc coffee currently offers me this measure, their gracious efforts to fulfill it notwithstanding. i recognize and appreciate that my opinion is actually valued and listened to here; i appreciate especially that my wishes regarding my schedule are respected -- this is no small thing; i don’t doubt that bloc would show me more fiscal gratitude if they felt they could. yet what remains is that i’m not getting paid what i want, and furthermore [a fully entangled issue], i don’t want to work for a company that isn’t breaking even. i’ve been down that road and it’s not worth it. so, i want to get paid more, and i want bloc to be able to afford it.

in another respect, my situation is this: i have worked in coffee for seven odd years. there is a lot that i love about this work, a lot that keeps me coming back to it. and overall, i would say coffee has been good to me -- it’s always given me a job anyway. on the other hand, over these seven years i’ve nearly made only less and less money, while i’ve grown more competent and worked harder. that is frustrating. i haven’t got anywhere, in terms of formal respect or remuneration, it seems to me. at this juncture in my life, at my age, twenty five, the time has come to set aside childish things. in the simplest terms, i want to either run my own coffee shop, or get out of coffee.

i don’t require or expect this change to come suddenly, but here the road diverges -- i must move one or the other direction from this point.

more later..

so, regarding politics, i’m thinking about compiling the observations about the american system that seem relevant to me. i really don’t know that this initiative will progress at all. i could easily imagine getting sick of it pretty fast. nonetheless, here goes, i guess, starting nowhere in particular.

we just had a ‘midterm’ election. control of the us senate transferred from the democratic party to the republican. this leaves us with a textbook example of a ‘lame duck’ session of congress, where the outgoing [democratic] president shall be expected to achieve absolutely nothing while the opposite [republican] party controls the legislature.

currently, the us senate is comprised of 53 democrats, 45 republicans, and 2 independents. after this election cycle, when the new senators take office, it appears the situation between the democrats and republicans will be reversed, while the numbers stay the same.

the house of representatives remains under the control of the republicans, who have held it since 2011.

note: this congressional cycle ending in january is counted as the 113th.

there are 102 women in the 113th congress (19% of the total). this number has slowly but monotonically increased since the 70s, when women represented less than 4% of the total. it has generally increased since 1917 when the first woman was elected to a national office [jeanette rankin, republican representative from montana]. 82 of the congresswomen today are in the house, 20 in the senate. of those in the house, 62 are democrats, 20 republicans. of those in the senate, 16 are democrats and 4 are republicans.

there are currently 7 openly gay members of congress, 1 senator and 6 representatives, all democrats [about 1%]

14 democrats and 20 republicans are under 40 years old [all but 1 democrat serve in the house]. on the other hand, 21 [12 d, 9 r] senators and 43 [28 d, 15 r] representatives are over 70 years old.
