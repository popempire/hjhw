armistice day [veteran’s day] mmxiv

~

some questions for eddy’s ambassadors:
what music or musicians are you most interested in right now? why?
what is/are the central theme[s] in the discussions of the ambassador ensemble?
what is an ambassador? do you see yourself as one, and if so, how?

this dog’s panting is driving me crazy. these breathing and licking sounds make me feel it is impossible to concentrate. ugh. it’s disgusting.

ben nava expressed interest last night in being a tenant farmer/farm manager on the suhre land. i think it could be a perfect fit with my mother’s aspirations to do organic farming on the land.

i talked to django kroner about the treehouse ariana and i will be staying at in a couple weeks. i asked his advice on how to deal with the cold… blankets and cuddling, as one might have guessed. i talked to him a bit about his business -- the canopy crew. he does tree care in the greater cincinnati area and will build treehouses anywhere in the world, if the money is there. he currently has tree care projects going on in indian hill and another place way out the east side. he is hoping to start his own treehouse rental company. [the treehouse we are renting for a few days is jill hicks’ -- she co-designed and helped build it, and owns it on her land].

i talked to dylan tennison about purchasing some of his good greens. he is such a nice fellow.

i talked to dave mcdonnell about ariana babysitting for dorothy again, and receiving a push lawnmower from him. they liked having ariana babysit, and dorothy loved her, but apparently she tried to string ariana along for all she was worth. dorothy apologized to her parents for lying to ariana. they said if she lied to her she might not come play with her again. dorothy was very sorry then.

all in all, it was another monday night at the comet.

the issue has been raised, that monday night at the comet is overwhelmingly white and male -- the performers and patrons. hmmm…

continuing my vague investigations of us politics, here now is the topic of abortion.

the us supreme court declared abortion to be a fundamental right in 1973 [roe v. wade] and since then it has been legal upon request throughout the country. why then does it remain so hotly debated a topic?

[http://abortion.procon.org/]

it is almost too obvious to point out, but here is a key feature of the american political landscape:

78.4% of americans identify themselves as christians. this category positively dwarfs any other group. less than 5% identify as adherents of some other religion, with judaism weighing in as the most popular of these at a whopping 1.7%. this is about the same as the number who identified as atheists [1.6%], just slightly less than the number of agnostics [2.4%]. interestingly, “nothing in particular” [under the heading of unaffiliated] was a rather popular poll choice, with 12.1% [these were split roughly half and half secular unaffiliated and religious unaffiliated].

further demarcating the christians, protestants make up 51.3% of the us population, a striking figure in itself. catholics are 23.9% of the us population, with other christians making up a little over 3%.

[note also, in the cited page below, how the demographics are shifting -- the unaffiliated category has been growing.]

*i am unable currently to find useful data on how protestant churches in general, especially evangelical churches, teach about abortion. obviously this is a divided and multifarious group, that doesn’t share a standardized teaching. it is easier to find what the catholic church teaches, since there is a formal hierarchy and a well-defined message from the top down.*

the catholic doctrine is that abortion is always wrong, and that it ought to be illegal.

interestingly, catholics themselves do not strictly adhere to this, and in fact match the mainstream quite closely in their views of abortion [and stem cell research]
