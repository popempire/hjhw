I light my cell by candlepower
the flame is sweet and fresh
and pleasant to the touch
my air is full of dreams
and the songs of angels with wings
and candleflames
but my air is full of dreams
that bleed
drops of ink out of my head
and feed the paper
by the light of candles

=========

in the slithering silence
of the smiling night
wandering through the willows
fishing for a fight
come the limping goblins
short and short of sight

bar & bar the window
lock & lock the door
there are little angels
headed for the floor
elfmen open up their mouths
holding out for more

=======

and were the world my napkin
  i'd scribble some letters
on trees and on the rock i'd write
  the names of people that i know
    or that i wish i knew
but then a drop of sea would spill
  upon my napkin there
and all the names would run and bleed
  and fade into the earth

i'd try to resurrect the ink
  the wind is my own breath
i'd lend the wind to them
  i'd send the birds to them
    to wake them up
  but they would not wake up
the ink would not so clear and crisp
  as once whisper those names
i'd try to write the names again
  the earth would rip and tear
    the hills would skip
      vocanoes flare
    across the melting plain
but my friends would not wake up
  and they would stay asleep

========

i want to live on mountains, and
i want the harsher air;
i want to float in that abyss--
god keeps his secrets there
there is no place so precious, though
it's hidden everywhere

in the whispers of the night
there are angels speaking
and in the whiskers of the trees
in the branches creaking
there are sweet and secret things
i have long been seeking

in the shadows on the walls
and the twisting flame
there is a dance much wilder than
any vernal game
would it could show my eyes its joy
and teach my soul the same

=========

when the moon is smiling down
all the stars are winking
to see the sun has fallen down
and to see him sinking
in the rolling western sea
in the rising western sea
that the fish are drinking

slithering down the silent sky
children of the moonbeams
sightless sylphids on the air
who act as if they wish to say
nothing's as it seems
will smile now with warm white light
...

by the lighted lanterns
on the windowsills
shadows on the nightdew
and the humpback hills
creep from black to blackness
crawling in the rills

wander through the fire now
sticking out your tongue
lapping up the golden flames and
pixies that are hung
off faerie ropes they twisted from
the sparks and twirling ribbon blaze
with ashes in each lung
...

and the moon is smiling down
all the stars are winking
...
