the earth is twirling
my head is swirling
my day has turned to night
im shaking at the sight
of the darkness all around

the sky is whirling
my breath is curling
the words are spoken now
i feel so broken now
i wish i could stop the sound

...
my sky is broken now
soon i'm gonna hit the ground

the earth is twirling
the light is swirling
where the daytime meets the night
its messing with my sight
think i am sinking underground

========

now stop feeling sentimental
melt melt we are made of metal
bang bang the hammer on the anvil
... tomorrow we are dying

life's a breeze, a breath and it is gone
i love to feel sorry for myself

=====

like the deer longs for the water from the stream
so my soul is longing for my god

=======

and i am drinking in
this amazing grace
while my fingers interlace
thorns i'm linking in
this crown that's sinking in
crimson beads drop down his face

i am drinking in
this amazing grace
angels interlace
my prayer crumbling
ashes humbling
the smoke and air are intertraced

=====

death will lead us homeward
like dark roads through the night

======

everything that i make falls apart
god you know what its like
when you breathe in the dust & you choke

========

i wanna feel so happy
i wanna feel beautiful
i wanna feel in love
i wanna feel this risen life

i wanna live so happy
i wanna live beautiful
i wanna live in love
i wanna live this risen life

i wanna be...

=======

i'm painted and pretty
my hair woven gold
ill be happy ill smile
when anyone walks by
love me want me
take me home with you


i'm painted and pretty
like an angel on a wall
a lovely face
i'm painted and pretty
and i will smile if anyone comes by
to look at me
to look at me
i'm painted and pretty
and maybe it's frozen
but you've never seen such
a lovely face

love me want me
take me home with you
love me want me
take me take me take me home with you

i'm porcelain and fragile
love my shell so i don't feel
hollow
i'm porcelain and fragile
so when you hold hold me in your arms
please hold real tight
please hold real tight
i'm porcelain and fragile
and maybe i'm faking
but i look like i don't feel
hollow

(chorus)

========

this old world is gonna burn
when i rule the sun
this old world is gonna drown
when i rule the sea
