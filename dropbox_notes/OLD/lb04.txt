The shell is in the chamber
  so shoot me up
when this is all over
  you can wake me up

===================

there was a time when every thought was you
there was a time when this day was new

i still remember when this day was new
i still remember when i loved you

And when i hear your song i can resist
  i still remember

===================

seven birds go walking
  on a sunny day
and the birds are talking
  all along the way
they discoursed of the flowers
  and fishes in the bay
as little tiny spiders
  record the things they say
like clerics in the towers
  in tandrickensmay
high above the riders
  fighting in the fray

===================

Vanity vanity
flagship of humanity
glamour of the empty sky
sparkle in the serpent's eye
i sing to you

i wanna feel happy
i wanna feel beautiful
i wanna feel in love

... tree
... tree
hallow this idolatry
my desire hangs so near
as a whisper on the ear
i sing to you

===================

i fell in love with a robot doll
she has eyes but she can't see me at all
i fell in love with a lady ghost
wanna tell her that i love her the most

i fell in love with someone in my head
love her till i'm biochemically dead

===================

Ye hallowed spirits plead for me
and light the sky above this twisting sea
ye the stars that guide me home
...

christ my savior hear thou my prayer
...
be thine the spirit that breathes the words
...

plead ye for my floundering soul
and light the sky
oer this blackhearted sea
be the stars that point me home
then yield the sky
to the flamefaced dawn

===================

This fantastic new sensation's
  like electric in your brain
magical electromagnets
  rattle your soul with incantations

===================

i just wanna write a poem
and make it sure i've got a soul
cause maybe if i write a poem
itll mean something more than this

i just want to write a poem
or a song someone will like
cause maybe if i write a poem
people are gonna like me too

===================

mister john fowler youre a fool
fight tom black and youre a dead man too
take my advice and get outta town
take him on and hell shoot you down

you listen here man
i got a gun
i aint afraid and
aint gonna run

cold tom black is slick as ice
loads his gun and loads his dice
pistol firin finger flickers like flame
plays at death like a childrens game

bang bang jackie
the world is gone
bang bang jackie
we'll sing your song

===================

well now the literate man
is full of superstitions
scientific laws
and phony apparitions

now i'm the face of true religion
ill crack a smile at anything

ive got no inspiration
ive got no feeling at all
im playing robot music
and its trickling out of my ears

===================

do you love me?
do you love me?
i can feel you like a tree
in a cinnamon sea
but do you love me?

===================

see your name in lights!
aha. ahahahaha. aha. aha.

we'll all be stars!

===================

he cries at night cause john lennon's dead
and he does the hokey pokey to radiohead

===================

my love i am broken
for i have loved thee
forsaking all others
have loved thee alone
thou doest unjustly
to cast me away
to turn to another
and sail far away

the depths of the ocean
are heavy for thee
the stretch of the heavens
is lonely for thee
remember i love thee
and come back to me
forsaking all others
return home to me

===================

were you alone my lord in the garden?
were you alone my lord in the garden?
were you alone my lord and did you pray to god?

were you alone my lord in the wilderness?
were you alone my lord in the wilderness?
were you alone my lord when the devil spoke?

were you alone my lord before the world began?
were you alone my lord before the world began?
were you alone my lord and did you speak out loud?

are you alone my lord a million years from here?
are you alone my lord a million years from here?
are you alone my lord...

===================

when the moon is smiling down
all the stars are winking
to see the sun has fallen down
and to see him sinking
in the rolling western sea
in the rising western sea

===================

when this life is over
no one really knows
but theres a story that i heard
when your time is come
for you to leave this place
a line of angels comes
and takes you into empty space
they turn out all the lights
and they set your soul ablaze

===================

death has a secret he cannot keep
love has an anthem that he sings alone
wisdom has a counsel she cannot speak
sorrow has a shadow that sweetens the sun

life has a moment she cannot keep

===================

god bless all the happy people

===================

faith come back to me
faith come back to me
i'm losing my sight
in the darkness of the night
faith come back to me

hope come back to me
hope come back to me
im drawing my breath
on pain of death
hope come back to me

love come back to me
love come back to me
though the coming of the day
is a hundred million miles away
still love come back to me

===================

i am standing in the shadow of the world
the world casts a shadow upon itself
