The world is the totality of conscious agents, not things.

Two types of men who would brandish power over women — magistrates & magicians 
you could call them. The one derives his power from his status within the 
(patriarchal) society — his money, his family, his connections or legal right — 
i.e. his relationship to other men in his realm. The other from his charm, his 
allure, his skills of seduction, romantic & sexual mystique. This latter is 
somewhat interesting because this power must be derived from the fount of 
womanhood, the holiness of femininity i.e. the power & grace of the goddess. 
Yet here it is a severely degraded form of magical power, & probably we are 
unjustly generous to call this man "magician". Why this eroded magic has any 
efficacy at all is perhaps because the magic of the goddess has been so widely 
suppressed in general that this little shimmer may be all that calls out to some 
of those who are susceptible to her magic.

This distinction is quite different from jocks vs nerds.
