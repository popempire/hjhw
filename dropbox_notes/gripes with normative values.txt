Most people are really bad at characterizing themselves. They are either lying
or delusional. We are so much better at identifying the traits and qualities of
others—especially when it comes to errors and negative features. (Think of the
people you know well—and wouldn't you say you're more keenly aware of many
important parts of their nature than they? that they have at least a few
significantly skewed elements of their self-image?) But we don't follow this
line to its rational end: we don't imagine that it applies just as well to
ourselves.

The gripe I have, however, is that we generally take people at their word in
describing themselves. In fact we consider it very upright to accept what people
say about themselves. Yet the one thing I really know is that people are always
mischaracterizing themselves intentionally and unintentionally—this source of
information is patently unreliable.
