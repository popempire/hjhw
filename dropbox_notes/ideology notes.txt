ideology is closely correlated with associative network

concepts are seen to be distinct from words when we consider that a word may
have two meanings which are represented by different words in another language..

one major organizing principle in our culture is intellectual laziness.

a *spirit* is an unexplainable principle that causes motion or change of state
in a body. it is not material, but is defined its material influence.

when you think about cause and effect
consider the atomic bomb
you think about a massive explosion and a mushroom cloud
you know that a great part
possibly the greater part of its effects are invisible
the poisonous radiation spreads and lingers
contagion takes up residence throughout the surrounding area
our leaders were only hazily aware of this when the weapons were first developed and used
to the extent that they were aware they actively suppressed knowledge of the true effects
word got out nonetheless
now people generally know better
the secretary of war wrote in time in 1947
[it] was more than a weapon of terrible destruction
it was a psychological weapon
and the psychological burns and scars on the hibakusha are invisible
they are intelligible and their effects are in the material world
if you want to understand cause and effect
the invisible things may be the largest part of the picture
it is easy to focus on the visible things, the explosions

when you look at the world of people and you try to make sense of it
you find that the people all act and understand their own actions in the terms
provided by their culture
and these terms are communicated in words
when you look at the world of words and you try to make sense of it
you soon realize that all the words and their associations are arbitrary
they might have been arranged any other way
they have not always been as they are now and tomorrow they shall be new again
and you realize that people judge their lives according to the values provided to them by their culture
and these values just as light and insubstantial as words!
it seems that all is adrift in an awkward balance
floating in space, as it were, always falling but neither going up nor down nor any which way
for to say which way one must postulate an observer
a subject
and this self seems to disappear from our view
i imagine it as something like taking the limit of a function
the province of the observer diminishes until all is adrift in a sea of relativity

but for all this
nature is never spent
and when i consider desire and dreams
all these listless matrices disappear
things take a definite form
it doesn't matter to one who feels she has had her portion stolen
whether she should believe that justice is a foolish concept of an invasive species of ape
whether right and wrong are arbitrary
or rather even, whether she ought not to thank the hand that takes the food from the mouth's of her children
and render the priests and kings adulation for their blessing on her
it does not matter to her
*instead* let language give expression to this one's outrage
and fear and disappointment and heady lust for revenge
because if she spoke about it, others could hear and understand
[this last is indeed a remarkable fact, which we must always remember
at the same time as we remember that it happens everyday all the time]

the conceptual problem with imagining the selfsubject
as if a region on a plane
