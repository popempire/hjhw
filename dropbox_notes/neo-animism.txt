neo-animism
===========

there is something *it is like to be* a stream or a rock or a star or
a galaxy

anything we could possibly say about *what it is like to be* such a being is
entirely metaphorical

*for itself*, such a being could have nothing to say about what it is like to be
some other rock or stream or creature or cosmos

the future draws us into itself—the beings that we are draw us into ourselves—we
brought about organic evolution to effect ourselves—our technology brings us
about to manifest itself

we cause gods and forces in our experiences of meaning—the fundamental act
i.e. fact i.e. the real thing is meaning, the beings are its theoretical
reverberations

what is the meaning of life?—the awkwardness of this question is apparent when
we remember this [re]ordering of fundamental reality. [the mainstream order is
to take the matter energy and spacetime as given and wonder what the meaning of
life is, finding it to be elusive evanescent and uncertain—take instead the
meaning as given and suppose the material to be uncertain. (v.i.)] replace with:
what is the matter of life? what is the spacetime of life? what is the energy
field of life?—do you want to know, what sort of things are these? or do you
rather want to know the specifics.. where is the matter in my life right now in
my immediate vicinity? where is the floor? which way is up? is it light or is it
dark?—the theoretical and the practical types of knowledge are entirely separate
things here, and also with meaning. one is analytical, the other is perceptual.
what is the meaning of life?—do you want to know what sort of thing that is? or
rather what matters right in this very moment in your inmost being? for your
love?

 *  this is the mainstream folly that is sometimes criticized as overly
    “scientific” thinking (v.i.). it is not the kind of beings we truly are. that is,
    scientific theories and descriptions do not explain magic, magic explains
    the scientific theories, and makes very specific ones very special apart
    from the endless realm of scientific descriptions and theories.
    additionally, *any closed set* of theoretical analyses do not reliably give
    us anything useful i.e. practical knowledge. [the problem with people who
    overly criticize scientific thinking is that they are so eager to deny the
    scientific theory, which after all is never perfect, that they readily deny
    the real magic too.]

     *  though really *materialism* should bear the blame—the mistake is not
        inherent to science or scientific thinking

you are a being made of meaning existing in a world of meaning. all the matter
that comprises you and the world arises out of meaning.

the greatest tragedy of all is to be a self. the saddest thing in the world is
that all beings to encounter themselves alone.

from this stems the importance of kindness, compassion, love.

the god of the self is a god of love, or aspires to be

who finds, unfortunately, it is not yet possible to die

according to the finest understanding of contemporary physics, it is possible
and perhaps overwhelmingly probable that at any moment our spacetime itself
should suddenly be shredded ripped apart in an incomprehensible nearly
instantaneous and cataclysmic expansion or contraction. of course we also know
this is impossible i.e. we could never possibly talk about it.

you & i can talk about anything. it is the fundamental thing we have in common.

*to be present* is the most important capacity of being[z]

*physics* is composed of *statics* and *dynamics*—the studies of physical systems
and the ways they change, respectively.

 *  our own conceptual framework is suited to these two views of physical
    reality. it is intuitive to us that physical systems will assume certain
    states, and  that these states will change through time according to certain
    patterns. it is not here relevant whether reality can be *fully* described
    by a  predictive model—only that predictive, mathematical models are
    intelligible to us.

 *  thus, we have detailed mathematical models available to us to describe the
    state that our physical reality is in, and to describe its change through the
    flow of time.

 *  what is *not* available to us is any sort of representational model of how one
    becomes *present* at a certain specific time or place.

our cognitive apparatus natively interprets reality in the emergence of binary
pairs, fundamentally order & chaos. we don't have to think that reality
fundamentally consists in the binary opposition of order & chaos, but we are
wise to recognize that we ourselves will always fundamentally encounter it
through this opposition.

 >  when all you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail

we fundamentally encounter the world through our 3+1 dimensions. we don't have
to commit ourselves to believing that our physical world is best described
fundamentally in terms of this dimensionality, but we cannot excuse ourselves by
force of will from fundamentally experiencing it in these terms.

for realistic, mortal beings, to be *somewhere* means *not to be* somewhere else.
yet conceptually, being present somewhere does not entail the negation of being
elsewhere. the concept of of god's omnipresence is not unintelligible, whether or
not any being possesses such a trait.

MYTH SYSTEM
===========

MYTHSTEM
--------

fundamentally here is this idea—that we have the visible world on one hand—all that
is observed or perceived—and the unseen world on the other hand—and that this
unseen world undergirds and gives rise to the visible world. the invisible world
makes the visible world *possible* and *meaningful*.

so—what do we have to say about **science**?

*science* is obviously allied to the visible world. in fact, in its most basic form,
science is simply looking around and noticing things. extend that notion with the
idea of collecting and integrating these repeated lookings around and noticings,
and you have the whole idea of science (as a human pursuit, not as a modern
institution, of course).

*scientific materialism* might be characterized as the position that the only
reality is material, that science eliminates the conceptual need for any metaphysical
reality—thus, everything that *is* is theoretically observable by material
apparatus.

this is a position taken up for *methodological* reasons in the practice of
science—it makes sense to practice science with the assumption that any change in
reality is one that may theoretically be observed. yet as eminently practical as
this proposition is, no practitioner of science is required to stand by it as a hard
line—science herself makes no claim to be able to explain *everything*, only to
be able to explain ever *more and more*.

yet some unfortunates have taken this stance of materialism up in a serious way.
