it is the peculiar privilege of all living things to die

recording is a way of preparing for death

one lives not *denying* death but *defying* death

this way of life welcomes death into the warm embrace of combat



obsession is necessary and useful for recording work

a mind prone to fixating on small problems
is suited to certain aspects of recording work
