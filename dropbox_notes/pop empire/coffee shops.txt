John- barista, amateur mixologist 
Ethiopia Yirgacheffe, city plus roast 
Medium full body, very chocolatey, pleasingly sweet and with a bit of berry acidity remaining but considerably over-roasted for my taste.
[Ariana tasted--I believe--the same bean on a separate visit, and found it very floral]
The shop operates a 2-group Rancilio and offers Clever dripper
Owned by a couple who roast their own and make their own [very tasty] pastries from scratch
