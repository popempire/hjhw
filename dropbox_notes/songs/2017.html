Ride in on the westbound<br />
to a terminal disease<br />
now the old day's dried up, shake it,<br />
break it, bend it at the knees<br />
just take me to your leader, kiddo<br />
take me to your king<br />
'cause i'm the cat's meow<br />
and i'm the new big thing<br />
see me dancing on the ballast<br />
with the leopards of the palace<br />
here we go
</p>
<p>
Ride a bolt of lightning<br />
on the rosy tips of dawn<br />
our brand new age is brightening<br />
and the yesterday's are gone<br />
so put me in the center, baby<br />
put me in the scene<br />
'cause i'm the phantom king<br />
of twentiseventeen<br />
i'm burning just a little<br />
as the city plays the fiddle<br />
here we go
</p>

Mother raised you right<br />
taught the way<br />
how to keep in the light<br />
Father raised you well<br />
showed the way<br />
how to keep you from hell<br />
When death comes on the wing<br />
cock your hat<br />
wear the feathers he bring
</p>
<p>
Raise your baby right<br />
show him which<br />
are the demons to fight<br />
Raise your baby well<br />
show the way<br />
how to keep him from hell<br />
When death comes in the spring<br />
grow your hair<br />
wear the flowers he bring
</p>
