I got friends—So-called friends 
They're so sweet & suicidal
Sorta free Sorta brave
So afraid & conflicted

I get so hung up on people & I want them to be close 
But I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind 

{Kid I like you—Wanna be like you
I don't care I'll cut myself too |
You know I like you & I don't care 
I cut myself To be like you}
I wanna love Because it hurts to love
And I wanna hurt Because I want a feeling 

I am sick broke down defeated & if I don't leave this place 
God I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind 

Hit the wall I'm freaking out 
Lost control Nothing's helping 
Hold me now 
Hold 
me 
now
I'm going down In a spiral

Everything is broken & I want it to be fixed 
God I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind

Yeah yeah yeah
Hold me now 

===

Jesus & Madonna keep your eyes out on the road
God I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind

===

I hit the wall I'm freaking out
Lost control Nothing's helping
Hold my hands Cross your fingers 
Tell me how I shouldn't mind it

Lost control Hit the wall
Hit my head At 90 miles
Holding hands Crossing fingers 
I wanna say I don't mind it

Kick my head Against the wall
Think I've sorta Lost control 
Holdin hands Crossin fingers
I wanna say I don't mind it

But I feel sick broke down defeated 
And if I don't leave this place 
God I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind

I wanna like you Wanna be like you 
So surreal And transcendent 
You're in my head I wanna cut you 
I don't care I'll cut myself too

I get so hung up on people 
And I want them to be close 
But I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind

I got friends (So I call them)
They're so sweet And suicidal
Sort of free Sort of brave
So afraid And afflicted 

Everything is fucked up
And I want it to be fixed
But I think I'm gonna lose my lonely mind

===

I got friends
(So I call them)
They're so sweet 
And suicidal


===

I wanna like you
I wanna be like you
I wanna say
I don't mind it
I feel sick
And I'm angry
Broken down 
And defeated


===

My life since dropping out of school
===========================

I'd like to say
I don't mind it
But I feel sick
and I'm angry


I got lots
Of so-called friends 
They're all tryna
Give me the bait 
They don't like me 
But they know me
'Cause they seen me 
Hangin' round 
I get so caught up on people 
And I want them to be close
But I can't afford to lose that lonely spark

So I go home 
Walking by
All the windows 
To my past
And I think 
Of the daytime 

Everything is broken 
And I want it to be fixed
But I can't afford to lose that lonely spark

Lonely heart 
Beats a drum
And it sounds
Like a whisper 
And who are we
To take these things 
Holding hands 
Crossing fingers 

---

In my mind 
I wanna cut you 
I don't care 
I'll cut myself too

I don't lie
I'm on the fritz
