It was drivin home
Listenin to 90.9
When I got the call
She was doin 85
Crossed the double yellow . .

Lookin left right left
And all manner of good vigilance
Comes naturally to me
Yet how can the world
Go second by millisecond 
Constantly renewed
And she not be here
My side by her little side
A warmness all around?

...
Strange bright morning after 
Longing letting go
