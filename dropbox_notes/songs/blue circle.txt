blue circle got me all wound up
how could i know till i found out?
come on baby don't you wanna go
my sweet home ohio

i got a little house at the foot of the hill
fifteen minutes from everywhere
no matter how far i go
wind up knocking on that same old door

(she say) hey, rider,
whatcha doin here so soon?
you gotta let me get one day
out the seven day week

blue circle keep me up at night
black sky and electric light
drinkin booze and waking up at two
doin all the work that a man can do

big apple
blue circle got me caught on the line
straight shot from heaven above
twenty-four hours on a greyhound bus
my own little baby gonna kill my buzz

(she say) hey, rider,
whatcha doin here so soon?
you gotta let me get one day
out the seven day week

blue circle dont give me the time

people call me just another guy
