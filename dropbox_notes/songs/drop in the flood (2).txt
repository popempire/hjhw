some people want to be a big fish [ie in a small pond]
lord knows i want to be a lake [ie a big pond]
i want to be an island all to myself [no man is]
of salt, ashes and blood [genesis 19:26, exodus 12:13]

the monumental everyday
vaults up above my world
the underneath coiling infinite strange o well, [sprung rhythm|http://www.bartleby.com/122/100.html]
just a drop in the flood [the human's constructed reality is based upon binary oppositions that constantly leave her somewhere in between, out of communion either with the multitudinous Nature of herself and fellow man and all the world or with supreme beautiful perfect Wisdom on the other hand.]

[#refrain]pp

lord o lord, what a lonely world i'm in
got the date and the number [confirmation #]
just waiting for the show to begin
(what a state i'm in)
just a drop in the flood

suns collide and the world almost ends
don't mean that much to me
got the supersonic traveller blues o well,
just a drop in the flood

lord o lord, what a lonely world i'm in
my raven of love, my desperate dove, good lord [the king of the mountain cometh - t. rex; genesis 8:6-12]
just a drop in the flood

some people want to be a big fish
lord knows i want to be a lake
i want to be an island all to myself
just a drop in the flood

Intro A A B A A B A A'

After brief intro riding on the tonic Eb, two vocal verses of form A, followed by a vocal refrain/bridge of form B: this followed by an instrumental then a vocal verse of form A, and again a refrain/bridge of form B; part A repeats once more instrumentally, then once more with vocals, the final turnaround being truncated.

this song was more or less written through 2011, incorporating some older ideas and settling into a shape basically resembling its present form in early 2012.

all around us we see people trying to get ahead, gain respect from their peers -- for many of us our self-worth is closely tied to how we see ourselves stacking up against these others. and consider how profoundly small is the pond that we might hope to dominate! it's somewhat relative, of course -- some people are comparing themselves to their immediate siblings, some to the people in their company, or in their profession, etc. some perhaps to the most-respected practitioners in the world of some tradition, a few deign to compare themselves to the foremost figures of history. (the great figures of history are all ideas, not people.) but it doesn't really matter what scale one is working with -- it takes only a little bit of context to conceive how minuscule is the sphere of human affairs at even its greatest extent through time and space. How much more microscopic is the sphere of any individual.
