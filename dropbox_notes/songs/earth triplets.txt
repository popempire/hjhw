I'm gonna move  
to Kansas City  
Honey where you ain't allowed 

I don't call it brave  
to feel no fear  
Honey when you ain't around 

===

but god-- ain't been no friend to me babe  
i'm with the dogs and the geese

it's wild-- wild in the west of here babe
northern wind blows in the day

but silence-- she been a root to me babe

my friends-- they been so good to me babe
i been a fool all the time

you know-- my heart ain't no friend to me babe
whisky and wine are the same

...

and i'm unmoved dear-- by all the great myths

lives down deep drags me away
down dark deep take me away
down dark deep fly me away
find me a hole in the sky-- give me to say

you know-- the song is the same to me babe
whether the dog is the dawn

and nonsense-- she is my walls for me babe
and lines the inside of the mind

the world makes no more-- more sense than my world to me babe

random fluctuations-- ain't they all lies to me babe

down dark deep this is the way
old heart's love give it away
sun gone down fly me away
summer is climbing the walls, she knows the way

Satan,
Turn on your high beams 

Turn my water to wine  
Take me with you
