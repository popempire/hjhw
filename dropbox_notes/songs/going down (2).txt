Judges 3:12-30

Everybody's talking 'bout going down 
To see the show 
I can't even wrap my head around it 
Look at them go 

Bodies made up of empty spaces 
That never touch 
Circumscribed by a viscous oozing 

The king's daughter in a violin string
evening gown
Drive the knife and the fat enfolds it
God smiling down 

If you want her you can have her here
On hallowed ground 

Maybe I'm the one that's broken 
Maybe this is paradise 
All these people find pleasure 
In things that I despise 



The scene unfolds in constant free fall 
Inarticulate mass
All these people find pleasure in things 
I despise 


B
There's a stone in my stomach 
...

People always tell me
Life's full of surprises
It finds a way
{For stockbrokers and flies |
Round and round again}

My friends always tell me
Of hope that paralyzes

...
World-weary water
Round and round again



Everybody's making their faces up
Talkin' bout, Gonna see the show
I'm alone at sea, can't wrap my head around it
{Look at them go | The scene unfolds}
Bodies made up of empty spaces
That never touch
Circumscribed by a viscous oozing
{It's a beautiful world | Inarticulate mass}

People always tell me
Life's full of surprises
It finds a way
Round and round again

The king's daughter in a violin string
Evening gown
Drive the knife and the fat enfolds it
God smiling down
