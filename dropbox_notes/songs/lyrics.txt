This fancy living
will take its toll
but what I really like is rock n roll

This fancy living
don't fill the hole
cause what I really like is rock n roll

This fancy living
will kill the soul
but what I really like is rock n roll

===============================

Sadie darling
may I hold your hand?
Said he to the
chains that held his tongue
but if I could
don't you know I would
break the city sunlight on your feet
just to make you know that I could love you

Lady Sadie
said she had no answer
pretty city
sunlight on her face
no triumphant bell
no secret smile
no broken heart, no moving on
I'll just stand here bent when I could love you

Sadie darling
you're my ancient folly
you're my word of
wisdom silently

A million orisons
a million twilight suns
may all break upon that pearly shore
...

===================================

It's so hard to get to you
it's so hard to know when you're coming through
And when I speak to you
I never really know who I'm speaking to
It's so hard to get to you
my mind just stops and my body flies

I wanna see your naked eyes
like the holy relic of a sinless age

====================================

All I wanna keep is a soul that's clean
with a loaded magazine and a bright green machine
they can send me off to heaven
when they put me on a tv show

All I really need is a bit of luck
a girl who'll share my name and a match with a flame
the girls are in the blackout,
the fire's in the blackout too


All I wanna do is something big
when the masterpiece don't fade, now do we make the grade?
the picture's in the blackout,
the fading's in the blackout too

All I wanna be is a superstar
starving artist downtown in a cowboy flat
the suckers couldn't kill him
so they put him on a tv show


Forget about your sorrow
forget about your happy
forget about the feeling of the inside of your skull


All I really want is some peace of mind
I can't see what I do, so I do it blind
the virtue's in the black out,
the beauty's in the black out too

All I really need is a pulse, don't you know
some sunshine and some rain, that's how the garden grow
nothing's gonna kill me,
they put me on a tv show


All I really need is a heart that's true
a temple with a view and a prayer or two




====================================

You gotta watch out for the ones
with the honey-coated tongues
all the words they let you hear
are drops of poison in your ear

You gotta watch out for the ones
with the silver forked tongues
all the words they let you hear
are drops of poison in your ear

You gotta watch out for the wheels
and the chrome appointed heels
yeah you love the way it feels
but you know it never heals

Watch out for the wheel
with a diamond dusted heel
Watch out for the room
with a delicate perfume
Beware of girls with pretty eyes
watch out for angels in disguise

======================================

learnin how to love and avoid temptation
but you're a sucker for the sweet sensation
bought a ticket to the new creation
gotta get some inspiration

you don't believe
all the things you perceive
you know the senses deceive
you but you don't want to leave
yet and they're dying for you
a dozen for a dime
but it doesn't cross your mind
that loving is a crime
shady politician with a glass onion eye
the news says he's a fairy
so we're pullin teeth for money
....
it's a big big world
but a tiny tiny planet

======================================

your pretty little soul is all skin and bone
