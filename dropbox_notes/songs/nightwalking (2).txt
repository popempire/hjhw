I wish that all my friends would wake up 
Come out and play with me in moonlight 
Drunken lonely wasted

Come out to play with me in moonlight
Silence and fear my old companions
Drunken lonely wasted

Sodium vapor lamplight on the pavement 
A furtive figure in the window 
Walking after midnight 

Come all you strange unearthly creatures 
Come all you children of the night 
Broken ragged hungry 

You try to get in my door 
But you ain't that skinny 
I ain't got the time 
To spend it wasted 
I want love's safe asylum 

The girl I'm loving is ghostly 
Remember you were born to die 
The moon takes over at nighttime 

I go out walking after midnight 
In the cool of morning air

The world I live in is earthly 
And sunlight plays over her face 

The moon takes over at nighttime

I can't máke sense óf the world 
What am I  supposed to do?
What my landlord tell me?
| my Landlord said boy your rent is come due
Whatcha gonna do about dat boy?
Whatcha gonna do about dat?
The world I live in is earthly 
Remember you were born to die 
The rent comes due at midnight tonight 

---

The life I'm leading is costly
Remember you were born to die 
The last one turns the lights out

The people I come from is warlike...
The girl I'm loving is ghostly...
The world I live in is earthly...


My baby don't want no satisfaction 

She's a real hot son of a gun


My words have all been forgotten 
Remember you were born to die 
...

The world that I love is earthly 
Sunlight over her face
The moon takes over at nighttime

There are some who are darkness 
There are others who are in the light 
You just see the ones in the light, babe 
Those in darkness drop from sight 
(Mack the Knife, my translation)

---

I go out walking after midnight 
All in the cool of morning air
Drunken, lonely, wasted
My words have all been forgotten 
Remember I was born to die 
And who's gonna save me from myself?

My baby don't want no satisfaction 
{She's a real hot son of a gun |
She's been sucking on the devil's dick}
The one-eyed are kings of blind men
The world that I know is earthly
Sunlight over her face
The moon takes over at nighttime 

There are some who are in darkness 
There are others in the light 
Vaunted robed dazzling 
You just see the ones in the light babe
The others drop from sight 
And drift away in the shadow

C
{As | If} sheep go down to the slaughter
Mama I was born to die
But I ain't standin' in line [here]

A
I go out walkin' after midnight
I hold a nation in my hand
Past to future I am unbroken 
... Forsaken

B
Young boy's up to no good

---

I go out walking after midnight 
Out in the cool of morning air 
She walks right beside me
You just see the ones in the light babe 
The others drop from sight 
Drift away in the shadow 

My baby don't want no satisfaction 
She don't buy the great myths of the age
Broken ragged hungry 
See the ones in the light babe
Others drop from sight 
Drift away in the shadow 

There are some who are in darkness 
There are others in the light 
Starlight round they shoulder 
The world I live in is earthly 
Sunlight plays over her face 
The moon takes over at nighttime 

---

Come on baby don't be strange 

Hello, hello, devil
Bad news been my friend 
Whenever I ain't got money 

My mother taught me much better 
If I'da listened to her I wouldn't be here 
By and by I'm regretting 
Things I oughtn'ta said
Who's gonna save me from myself 

Come on babe why so green and lonely 

---

The girl I'm lovin she is ghostly
Eyes like diamonds in the sky
...
See the ones in the light
{Shadows drift away |
Others drop from sight}

There are some who are in darkness
Some like diamonds in the sky
In the glow of starlight
Sun lights up the day
Moon takes over at night

The girl I'm lovin she is ghostly
She's at home in outer space
World I know is earthly
Sunlight over her face
Circles round the void

I'm goin out walkin after midnight
In the cool of mornin air
Drunken ragged hungry
See the ones in the light
Shadows drift away

Well the sun light up the daytime
Yes the moon light up the night
She lie right beside me
See the ones in the light
Others drop from sight

I wish that all my friends would wake up 
Come out and play with me in the dark 

9.9.6.9.9
9.8.6.9.9

Come all you strange unearthly shadows
Come all you children of the night 
Broken ragged hungry 
You only see the ones in the light 
Faces staring out of black windows 

Light struck and scattered on the pavement 

Lights streak and skitter on the pavement 

Silence itself {becomes | seems like} a presence 
Fearsome companion to me now 
Walking after midnight 
He said and then you shall know the truth 
Coming down the sky to set you free 

I pray my baby don't forget me 
If I should fade into the dark 

I wish that all my friends would wake up 

You only see the ones in the light 
Others drift away in the shadow 

The moon takes over in the nighttime 
The sun takes over in the morning 
I ain't fattening no more frogs for snakes

Drunken lonely wasted 
Broken ragged hungry 


He's in a cage of steel and concrete 

---

The only world I know is ghostly 
She's at home in outer space 
In the glow of starlight 
The sunlight playing over her face 
The moon taking over at nighttime 

Sodium vapor lamplight on the pavement 
A furtive figure in the window 
Walking after midnight 
You only see the ones in the light 
Others drift away in the shadow 

I wish that all my friends would wake up 
Silence and fear are my companions 
Drunken lonely wasted
You only see the ones in the light 

Come all you strange unearthly creatures 
Come all you children of the night
Broken ragged hungry 
And then you shall know the truth 
Coming down the sky to set you free

I go out walking after midnight 
Coming down the sky to set you free 
Wake up people wake up
