Nightwalking 
============

Come all you strange unearthly people  
Come all you children of the night  

===

Come all you strange unearthly creatures  
Come all you children of the night  
Broken ragged hungry  

I wish that all my friends would wake up  
Come out and play with me in dreams  
Drunken lonely wasted  
They only see the ones in the light  
Others drift away in the shadow 

{Sodium vapor lamplight on the pavement  
A furtive figure in the window  }
Sodium vapor lamp shines in the darkness  
Silhouettes a figure on the pavement  
Walkin after midnight  
You only see the ones in the light  
Others drift away in the shadow 

I go out walking after midnight   
Coming down the sky to set you free  
Vaunted hanging brightly  
You only see the ones in the light  
Others drift away in the shadow  
You only see the ones in the light  
Others drift away in the shadow

Feeling like a hole in the ground
Some are not waving but drowning 

My friend is brightest and best
Others drift away in the shadow

You only see the ones in the light 
Others drift away in the shadow 

Green soft moonlit meadow 

---

The one I love is brightest and best 
Others drift away in the shadow 

All my friends are brightest and best
Richer by far than the ego

Sodium vapor lamplight cracks the pavement 
A furtive figure in the window 
Walking after midnight 
Is brighter by far than the rest
Others drift away in the shadow 

The evil waits in the dark 
Round green soft moonlit meadow 

---

I wish that all my friends would wake up 
Come out and play with me in dreams 
Drunken lonely wasted 
Desolate heart beats a drum
What are you doing with your one life?
