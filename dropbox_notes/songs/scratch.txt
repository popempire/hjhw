you think you know where you gon go
you're goin nowhere and fast
while time keeps driftin on
you always drift to the past

you can make it first second or third
you just can't make it last

you can feed me all this shit
you can't know why i'm smilin
  ""     ""    i laugh

some people wanna be impressed
but i'm never impressed
some people wanna be surprised
but i'm never surprised

all my life i've been a traveller
everywhere that i go
and if i never make it home
i'll drop dead in the road


say i'm tired of this cat and mouse
yeah i'm tired of these games..
i know you know you 'n i are more than friends
i know you know the same..
so pretty baby won't you come on home
and retreat into my arms..
you've never needed any other guy
to tell you who you are..
it's been a long time
