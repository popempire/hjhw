my baby is all summer
then all winter
my baby don't celebrate
the spring
my baby don't tolerate
no evil in this world
she's the sweetest thing
and she's my girl

my baby cool silver
and electric blue
my baby can operate
my gun
my baby don't contemplate
no evil against her man
she's the sweetest thing
and she's my girl
