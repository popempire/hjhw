<b><u>Teenage Ambition</u></b><br />

<p>
All i wanna keep is a soul that's clean<br />
a girl who'll share my name and a match with a flame<br />
the flood is in the blackout<br />
the fire's in the blackout too
</p>
<p>
All i really need is a bit of luck<br />
a loaded magazine and a bright green machine<br />
well, send me off to heaven<br />
put me on a tv show
</p>
<p>
All i wanna do is something big<br />
and if the masterpiece don't fade do we make the grade?<br />
the picture's in the blackout<br />
the fading's in the blackout too
</p>
<p>
All i wanna be is a superstar star star<br />
starving artist downtown in a cowboy flat<br />
the suckers couldn't kill him<br />
they put him on a tv show
</p>
<p>
Forget about your sorrow<br />
forget about your happy<br />
forget about the feeling of the inside of your skull<br />
forget about your angry<br />
forget about your lonely<br />
gotta get back that velvet feeling
</p>
<p>
All i really need is some peace of mind<br />
No i can't see what i'm doing so i'll do it blind<br />
the virtue's in the blackout<br />
the beauty's in the blackout too<br />
</p>
<p>
All i really need is a pulse, don't you know<br />
some sunshine and some rain, that's how the garden grow<br />
noone's gonna kill me<br />
put me on a tv show
</p>
