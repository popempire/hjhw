Trials troubles tribulations 
Such as never been before 
When the sun don't shine his light 
And the moon all die of fright 
The fire come down from heaven 
The blood shall fill the sea

I've been chosen and anointed 
I am come at the dawn of time 
And so like lightning strike the east 
Flash far out into the west 
I am death there is no
Fullness without me 

The mark must be upon your forehead 
These worldly goods you then can buy 
Depart from me I never knew ya
I hear my blessed savior cry
No second sight no soft wind
Blows no hope for rest

Depart from me I never knew ya
I hear the blessed savior cry 
I am death there is no
Fullness without me
