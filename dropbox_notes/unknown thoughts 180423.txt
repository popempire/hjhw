moral rectitude is a straight line in a space of possibilities

there is one way to be right and an infinite number of ways to be wrong

the probability of doing the right thing is therefore arbitrarily close to 0

whether it is possible to live a perfectly good life — or even just to do the
right thing in a given time & place — is unclear

what is certain is that it is impossible to ~know~ that you’ve done the right
thing or lived a righteous life

the aim of human existence is happiness

happiness cannot be measured by our tools because we ourselves are the
instrument of its measurement

happiness cannot be bought or sold — yet happiness is likewise a type of
agreement

if commerce is the exchange of ~goods~ : these are invariably exchanged with
~bads~

a certain amount of bads with the goods is what you have to take — in this view
the agreement that is being made is fundamentally one with the commercialist and
himself — the consumer agrees within himself

alternatively, an act of commercial exchange can be seen as a kind of lattice of
interaction that helps support a fundamentally human agreement of a different
order

in this case, the exchange is not of goods and bads, but the playing out of
deeply rooted human emotions and the expression of intuitive patterns of thought

we are the unpredictable, and we are everywhere all the time dying in becoming
predictable

you can’t predict what’s going to happen with the market — even though you can
easily demonstrate that it follows objective rules and behaves in a
conventionally causal way — simply because that depends on what a bunch of human
people are thinking

you can’t say for sure what any bunch of people you are interconnected with is
going to be thinking — simply because you yourself are a factor

even if your individual thoughts were considered of trivial significance to the
shape of something as big as the global market, undoubtedly your individual
thoughts would be of great significance to your perceptual bias in assessing the
global market (and it would be impossible to know precisely the ~offset~ of this
bias because there is no fixed reference)

money is a game and it’s not fun anymore
