*The Black Death* is the name given by history to something that happened in the middle of the 14th century. This was about twenty-two generations ago, so most of us don't remember it too well. However, it still stands out, however blurry, as an immense canyon of trauma and despair, because the events were so extreme.

Over the course of two decades, plague swept across the humans. It may have started in the grasslands of modern-day Kyrgyzstan, in a population of marmots and their fleas. 

*Plague* is a terrible disease that afflicts humans, certain other mammals, especially rodents, and insects that live on these mammals.

The disease is sometimes referred to as *bubonic plague*, though in fact this is one of the three forms or manifestations of the disease. The others are *septicemic plague* and *pneumonic plague*. They are all caused by the same bacteria, and the only real difference is in the part of the human anatomy which has become infected, and in how that infection is able to spread to other hosts.

Bubonic plague is named for the characteristic *buboes* which appear on sufferers. This is a pretty cute name for something quite horrifying. These are large bulges or boils that form around lymph nodes that are extremely painful and filled with virulent, stinking pus. This is the most famous form of plague and also the most survivable—there's about a 20% chance you might just ride this one out.

Then there is *pneumonic plague*, where the infection has spread to the lungs. The sufferer presents with symptoms similar to the flu at first, headaches and coughing. Over the course of a couple days or so, you start coughing up bloodier and bloodier sputum, until eventually you basically drown in your own blood. This form of the disease is highly contagious because it can be spread by the coughing of an infected person, and it is over 95% fatal.

Finally, there is *septicemic plague*, where the infection has entered the bloodstream. This results in spots or boils all over the body—smaller and more numerous than the buboes, and not limited to areas around the lymph nodes. The nice thing about this form, however, is that it will often kill you so fast that there may not be enough time for all of the symptoms to develop. It's over if you get this form of the disease—fatality is essentially 100%.

Physicians would learn before too long that patients could be helped somewhat by lancing the boils!*

The disease is also sometimes referred to as *Black Death*, though historically this is a name for just one particular outbreak of the disease, within one particular wave of outbreaks, which occurred in the 14th century. This outbreak also goes by the name *The Pestilence*.

## The Great Pestilence

Pestilence is the traditional name of one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the rider of the white horse.

## Plague Reservoir

The bacteria that cause plague cannot survive indefinitely within typical human or rat populations. They quickly kill all hosts of these species which are susceptible, and are rejected from the bodies of those who inherit or develop immunity. The disease does not take long to run its course, after which the bacteria starve and die. However, the bacteria are able to strike a balance and persist among populations of the fleas of certain ground rodents such as marmots and giant gerbils. These rodents and their fleas form what is called a *plague reservoir*.

ME *plage*, from LL *plaga*, from L, "blow"; related to *plangere*

## Neolithic decline

So, plague is a disease that has swept through the humans not once but many times.

The received modern opinion is that plague is spread among the humans by this axis of evil, the trio of Yersinia pestis bacteria, the fleas that carry the bacteria, and the black rats that carry those fleas. Ever since this bacterium was discovered, towards the end of the 19th century, it has been blamed for the Black Death in combination with these animals. And this story of Yersinia pestis plus fleas plus rats does seem to explain the more recent pandemic of plague, which arose, as before, in China, in the middle of the 19th century, which was bad, but not nearly as bad as the Black Death.

However, some have raised doubts about whether these creatures can truly be blamed for the Black Death. In fact, no one has a full answer for why this wave of plague was so extremely severe, even compared to earlier and later plague pandemics, why it spread so quickly and killed so many people, and then, perhaps most mysteriously, why it disappeared for a little while, only to recur semi-regularly for three hundred-some years. Some have suggested that the Black Death may have been caused by some other disease, or plague in conjunction with some other disease, such as another bacteria like anthrax, or perhaps an unknown virus such as a new form of smallpox or an Ebola-like virus causing hemorrhagic fever. Or aliens.
