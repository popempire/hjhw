Nothing feels quite as wonderful as someone I admire showing me that they find me worth spending time with.

===

The arc of my life as a series of emotional states, frame by frame, the picture presented is a punctuated equilibrium with loneliness as the ground state. Loneliness is my home.

From a very early age I identified in myself a deep sense of lack of companionship. I wanted a brother. I wanted a best friend. If reality was not forthcoming with these, my psyche would have to invent them, for they were necessary to my being.

It is not exactly difficult to be social. I am strange and I have a ton of anxiety, but I don't doubt my basic social competence in any serious way, as far as is needed to navigate daily life and secure the bare necessities. But in making the connections that permit and promote spiritual growth and fulfillment, I often feel dangerously incompetent. Or maybe unlucky.

I don't seek any pity in saying this. Pity does nothing to cure loneliness or sadness. And what I'm describing in this experience of loneliness is essentially just the human condition, at least for many of us. It is very difficult and rare for two humans to make a sustained, meaningful connection. That's not quite any one individual's fault, that's just the circumstance that we find ourselves in.

Loneliness isn't an entirely negative feeling for me. It feels like home, in a way.

Something shatters in a moment, collapses in a vanishing duration, and the impact radiates in waves. Suddenly I was alone, and I became lonely by periodic bursts.

What does it mean to be lonely?

It is not the same as being alone. You can be lonely without being alone. In fact, this is very common, and is arguably much worse than being lonely and alone. Conversely, under the right circumstances, you can be alone but not lonely. When you are in a state of flow or communion with Nature, loneliness vanishes. It is even possible, perhaps with the aid of some psychotropic substance, to feel more connected to life, fundamental reality, and your fellow beings while externally alone than you ever do in ordinary, social life.

Loneliness implies the perception of a lack of a significant social connection in yourself, as well as the desire for it. This can be a manifestation of Instinct and a good thing, as it reveals something to us about ourselves and points out the Way to live.

Loneliness can lead to depression. This happens when you go from believing simply that you lack the social connections necessary to your thriving to believing that you lack the ability to establish and maintain these connections. This may be due to a perceived shortcoming in yourself, in the world, or both. Everything in life begins to turn gray and indistinct. Eating ceases to be perceptible as better than going hungry. Bathing ceases to be seen as better than going dirty. Living with all its attendant hardships ceases to appear greater than not living.

This is a real danger. How do we reintegrate Loneliness as Instinct in our lives, as our friend?

I am always inclined to compare life today with my imagined idea of how life was throughout the period of our species' evolutionary divergence. It is generally asserted that we spent most of our prehistory in communities of not much more than 150 people, mostly living nomadically in bands of thirty or so, mostly family. In contrast, most of us live in cities today, communities of thousands at least. Our social networks are congruent neither with our local communities nor our families. Instead, they are developed through a complex set of interactions and structures which are presented to us by society regardless of our input, but which require a great deal of active input and direction from us to operate. (We get to play the game but we don't make the rules.) Our cognitive apparatus for building and maintaining social connections remains much the same as it was some millennia ago, so we still attempt to settle into bands and communities of the same dimensions as in ancient times, yet despite the comparative over-abundance of people, this has not become easier. Our groups are far more fluid now. Over and over again, people enter our communities and then leave them. Once this was a rare and often traumatic experience. Now it is only traumatic.

It is very unlikely in modern society to experience true social devastation, the type of situation where your entire community is destroyed or dispersed. This is typically lethal for a human creature, unless they can find and assimilate into a new community quickly. In prehistoric times, and even certain parts of recorded history, this devastation was not entirely uncommon. One drought, one flood, one virulent disease, one warmongering tribe could bring the end of your social world. (Think of Genghis Khan's childhood.) Nowadays, it is simply not feasible that any of these things could cause that degree of damage, because there is an inexhaustible supply of people that share the same language and customs as you who can take the place of those lost. The most extreme cases of pandemic disease and genocide in the last couple centuries, while clearly horrific, demonstrate this.

However, the experience of isolation is extremely prevalent in modern societies as well. It is so common that many have identified it as the characteristic experience of our modern age. How can this be?

===

Talking with Rae Fisher last night, she said that she realizes that much of her loneliness and inability to relate to others comes from her own choices and path. I think this is insightful.

Obscuring or repressing your own inner life to make your experience appear more congruent with that of others undermines any possibility of making a true, meaningful connection. Yet honesty and vulnerability don't guarantee a connection either, and they can expose you to real psychological or physical danger.

=== 

For the buddhists, there is no universal. There may be nothing in your own individual experience that is truly shared by another individual. Your inner life is yours alone, and we only exchange symbols with one another.

It seems that your own past and future selves are exactly as inaccessible as other people as well. You may have a somewhat richer set of memories pertaining to your past self than you do with most other people, yet it is well known that memory cannot be trusted as reliable. And after all, it does not recreate the past, but only a representation. (We do Memory an injustice by thinking of her only as a recording device for the past.)

I also don't blame my loneliness on my star chart, although that is in vogue, nor on capitalism.

The experience of Betrayal

Betrayal is particularly tricky because it leaves us feeling lonely but also incapable of combatting our loneliness in the normal ways. First you lose the connection(s) that had preserved you from loneliness, and then you are too frightened to open yourself up in the ways that would allow you to form deep, new connections that could cure this.

Betrayal incites the desire for revenge in a way that loneliness, by itself, does not. Being lonely might make you feel that you cannot relate to other people, but it doesn't make you wish to make them lonely too. Experiencing betrayal makes you want to make someone else hurt in the way that you have.

===

I have bitterly criticized myself for the patience, passivity, and forgiveness that have permitted this betrayal, and for lacking the decisive will to cut out the negative commitments that I have made and replace them with (presumably) more productive ones.

I feel like I was betrayed by Ariana, who was probably the most important pillar of my life and my dreams. I feel like I was betrayed by my band Pop Empire, which was the other most important pillar. I feel like I was betrayed somewhat (but less so) by my parents in regard to purchasing my home at 3117 Warsaw. I feel like I was betrayed by my minivan, which was also my other home. In the first two cases, and also with my work at the coffeeshop, I feel like I was taken for granted and ignored in favor of brighter, shinier people and opportunities, despite the fact that I had established a record of steadfast commitment, passion, dedication, competency and generosity.

===

I want a partner who cherishes my sexuality. This is a little difficult even to imagine, because I am not entirely comfortable with my own sexuality. I have improved in this, but I still have a lot of internalized attitudes toward this as something taboo and sinful (outside of marriage). It is not helped by the fact that my partner of over seven years is and has been unable to cherish my sexuality in the way that I need. There is nothing wrong on her part in this by itself—it arises out of her nature and set of experiences—but in conjunction with her seeking to exert control over my sexuality for most of seven years, it has been a violence and a type of betrayal.

I want musical collaborators who cherish my creativity and desire to share music with the world.

===

I feel hopeless now, much of the time.

Does it feel good, comfortable, to feel sorry for yourself? What is the other option? to feel angry at yourself? God forbid you should do other than resent or pity yourself!

I don't want to continue to feel sorry for myself. But I want other people to be sorry for me! to recognize that I have suffered injustice, and to give me support.

How many people would need to acknowledge the injustice you have experienced for you to be satisfied? and what would their acknowledgement look like? and what support do you want? is kindness offered out of pity even desirable?

It wouldn't take many people, or much of an action on their part. A very few people, if they are the ones that matter to me, could make a huge difference, simply by listening to me and articulating the kind of hurt and betrayal that I feel as a relatable feeling. I don't want pity beyond this, and indeed pity from most people seems extremely off-putting. But I deeply want to hear from someone that I have been hurt unfairly, that I have something to give that is worth giving, and to believe this myself deeply enough that I regain the confidence to expend the considerable effort it requires to share these things, whether in a romantic relationship or a creative project.

Friend, you've been hurt unfairly. You should find joy and pride in the realization that you have maintained patience, kindness and loyalty in your relationships even through this hurt. You have beautiful gifts to give, despite your fear that the world, people both close to you and far from you, will reject or devalue those gifts. Ask yourself why these things and the desire to share them rise out of you.

Why does this love and this song arise in me? and why do I want to share it? and with whom?

It is Instinct, wedded to Tradition. Because my relation to others is the basis for Meaning. But what others?

Why does acknowledgment from some people count for so much in the weather of my soul, while acknowledgment from others may even be tedious?

These differences reflect differences in my beliefs about these people, differences in my expectations of what they can give me. Someone who could cover a lot of my needs appears very bright in my dark sky. Someone who cannot give me anything I'm looking for barely appears at all.

So it is necessary to make connections with the people who are fundamental or beneficial for my thriving.

I have often thought or felt or felt I ought to think that it is right to seek connections with people simply because they are there—that is, *these specific people* are here, now, and the grandeur of life is to experience the realness and nowness that I am immersed in, including, crucially, the people who have just happened to arise in the same tiny speck of spacetime as me.

Have you ever really lived this way? Whether by Nature or Tradition, you have learned to ignore most people, acknowledge some, and cling to a few. Your level of distress is correlated to the perceived degree of chaos in your world of people from your own point of view. The people closest to you matter for everything, but people farther away account for only a small arc in your sky.
