Pop Empire is my primary creative outlet. Over the ten years it has existed, its purpose has slowly become clearer to me.

Recently, as sometimes before, the internal voices that find me incompetent to establish the relationships that are fundamental to my thriving have gained a significant traction. These are voices that tell me I am a failure, and worse. This has to do with a lot more in my life than this musical project, but unfortunately, these voices have often been able to bring Pop Empire into consideration as convincing evidence of their case. Performing, publishing and promoting your own art invites endless opportunities to compare yourself and your achievements to others making similar art. It is already well know that this is the best way to rob yourself of Joy. After all, you only see the ones in the light.

Perhaps we humans are capable of, even responsible for, defining the terms of success in our endeavors. If so, then I understand Pop Empire to be a strategy given to me by Instinct and Tradition for keeping me alive, particularly against the threat of suicide. On those terms, it has been a successful ten years.

The method is to try to bring about the presence of the Divine—or perhaps more appropriately to bring its participants into awareness of that Presence. This is not always easy to do, especially these days. It becomes a very personal and difficult journey to find the practices and rituals that allow you to recognize your connection with the Fundamental Reality which undergirds all of perceived reality.

The truth is, I believe that I often have been blessed with the presence of the Divine through this project, particularly when I am patient and listen very deeply. And I believe that the music that comes out of this listening is truly worth sharing with the world because it could help others who are susceptible to the Divine in the same ways that I am. I hope that anyone who listens to this music has a chance to listen with their whole heart, to hear the words and find meaning in them. And if it has ever meant something to you, I hope you share it with someone who could use it in their time of need.

Pop Empire has always been intensely collaborative. In this way, it is the same as all of human life. Everything about it owes its final shape to my deeply talented companions, most notably Cameron Cochran, Jake Langknecht, and Katrina Eresman, as well as Ryan Back and Andy Jody. At the same time, I have come to realize that I take personal responsibility for the ultimate expression and continuation of this project, just as I take personal responsibility for my survival. Still, I couldn't handle either of those things without my friends.

I don't really approve of long posts like this on social media, but here I am anyway.

Pop Empire is my primary creative outlet. It is a band, I suppose you could say, though I'm not entirely fond of that term. Over some ten years, the Purpose behind this project has slowly become clearer and clearer to me. It is to keep me alive. It has always felt immediately *vital* and I would frequently use the term *life-giving*, but within the last year and the last few months especially it has really struck home exactly what the stakes are.

Recently, as they sometimes have before, the factions within my mind which would find me incompetent to establish the kinds of interpersonal relationships that are fundamental to my thriving have gained a significant foothold within my Internal Council. These are voices that tell me I am a failure, and worse. This has to do with a lot more in my life than this musical project, but unfortunately, these voices have often been able to bring Pop Empire into consideration as convincing evidence of their case. Performing, publishing and promoting your own art invites endless opportunities to compare yourself and your achievements to others making similar forms of art. It is already well know that this is the best way to rob yourself of Joy. You will almost always be comparing yourself to others with significant achievements in worldly terms, because after all, "You only see the ones in the light"*.

Some believe that we humans, as beings with complex self-awareness, are capable of and indeed responsible for defining our own terms of success in our endeavors. Perhaps this is true. If it is, then I understand Pop Empire to be a strategy given to me by Instinct and Tradition for keeping me alive, particularly against the threat of suicide. On those terms, it has been a successful ten years.

The method employed in this project for the prevention of suicide, as in all true art and music, is to try to bring about the presence of the Divine—or perhaps more appropriately to bring its participants into awareness of that Presence. This is not always easy to do, especially these days as all of our gods have generally been diminished to bogeymen. It becomes a very personal and difficult journey to find the practices and rituals that allow you to recognize your connection with the Fundamental Reality which undergirds all of perceived reality.

The truth is, I believe that I often have been blessed with the presence of the Divine through this project, particularly when I am patient and listen very deeply. And I believe that the music that comes out of this listening is truly worth sharing with the world because it could help others who are susceptible to the Divine in the same ways that I am. I hope that anyone who listens to this music has a chance to listen with their whole heart, and to listen to the words and find meaning in them. And if it has ever meant something to you, I hope you might share it with someone else who could use it in their time of need.

This project, Pop Empire, has always been intensely collaborative. In this way, it is the same as all of human life. Everything about it owes its final shape to my deeply talented companions, most notably Cameron Cochran, Jake Langknecht, and Katrina Eresman, as well as Ryan Back and Andy Jody. At the same time, I have come to realize that I take personal responsibility for the ultimate expression and continuation of this project, just as I take personal responsibility for my survival.

* This is a line from the refrain of my song "Nightwalking". It frequently returns to my mind in my times of trouble. It is stolen/adapted from "Die Moritat von Mackie Messer" aka "Mack the Knife" by Bertolt Brecht:

  > Denn die einen sind im Dunkeln
    und die anderen sind im Licht.
    Doch man sieht nur die im Lichte,
    die im Dunkeln sieht man nicht.

What threat is damnation to those who are already in Hell? Oblivion is sweet relief.
