Psychologists say that the Critical Inner Voice derives from internalization of the attitudes and statements of the primary caregiver(s) during early childhood.

My mom, in describing the sort of financial expectations she had for her life when she was much younger, says that she and my dad believed that if he just got to know the people working in the art side of the music industry, and they saw his work, he would consistently be able to get jobs and build a career. And, she says, for many years that's basically how it worked. They were quite poor when I was born, but my dad was already working freelance and had already had a couple of the jobs that would prove to be influential for him. All through the nineties, things steadily progressed for them, until one year—in the late nineties or very early aughts—my dad had a six-figure income. Then things slowly rolled back from there, more or less. I don't know how much they've averaged since then, but that has remained the high-water mark.

My grandpa, my mother's father, seemed to exude the attitude that you weren't really worth something unless you were a winner. You didn't have to be the fastest or the strongest necessarily—you could also be the smartest, for instance. But you kinda had to be a winner first to be somebody at all.

I grew up internalizing the idea that if you just work hard at something—anything you choose, at least if you have something of a natural aptitude for it—and get good at it, people will take notice and you will become successful, socially and financially. It was important to choose something that you were interested in and felt a passion for. It would be better not to ask for any attention, just to be given it.

i think a certain critical inner voice stands up when i begin to articulate any of particulars of my personal experiences and relationship with the goddess. and it takes a lot of time for me to work through that psychological opposition. i think i wind up spending a lot of time distracting myself and redirecting my attention as i begin to think about these things because it gets too painful for some reason and i come into danger of fixating and spiraling into a dark place. sometimes my brain is trying to protect me when it makes me "waste time" on dumb distractions.

my dad told me once when i was young, maybe 8 or 9 or slightly older, "you are very proud, henry" and it has always bothered me to this day

what if i tried to take the compliments that i get seriously? what am i worried would happen? the Critic points at the joyful self-content Voice and accuses bitterly, you will embarrass us!
